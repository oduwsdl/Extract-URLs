"Allopurinol has been used as a first­line drug for the treatment of hyperuricemia.3  Adverse reactions such as hepatic disorder, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and bone  marrow depression have been reported.4–8 Moreover, the dose of allopurinol requires  reduction according to the degree of renal impairment.9,10  Febuxostat is a nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase that forms a very  stable interaction with both the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme.11 Becker  et al reported superior efficacy of febuxostat compared with that of allopurinol in  diabetic gout patients.12 However, the efficacy of febuxostat was not superior to that  of allopurinol in the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Controlled Trial,6 and there was  no significant difference between the two drugs with respect to the rate of adverse  events (AEs).6,13,14 Efficacy and safety of febuxostat in elderly   female patientsJournal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Journal Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2014 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Mizuno et al Running head recto: Efficacy and safety of febuxostat in elderly female patients DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S70855",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a7/8b/cia-9-1489.PMC4158997.pdf
