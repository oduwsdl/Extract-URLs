"All GlcNAcstatins interact withthe active site of OGAs forming at least eight conserved hydrogen bonds (Figures 2A and 2B), the pyranose ring adopts a favoured 4E conformation, and conserved interactions with Asp297and Asn396 force the N2 substituent to adopt a conformation compatible with the proposed substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism [20,28,29], with the carbonyl oxygen approaching the sp2hybridized carbon to within 3.4 Å. GlcNAcstatins A–D inhibit hOGA in the low-nanomolar to sub-nanomolar range, while CpOGA is inhibited in the low picomolar range, implying that there are some (minor) differencesin the GlcNAc-binding pocket between hOGA and CpOGA, even though the active sites of these enzymes are almost identical as c/circlecopyrtThe Authors Journal compilation c/circlecopyrt2009 Biochemical Society © 2009 The Author(s) The author(s) has paid for this article to be freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/d1/46/bj4200221.PMC2691177.pdf
