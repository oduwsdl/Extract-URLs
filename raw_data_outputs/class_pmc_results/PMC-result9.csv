"Given the eﬀects of point mutations within the RRMs on multiple steps in gene expression (10,12–14), it is unlikely that the abilityof PrA-RG to support growth is due to facilitating anyof these processes through direct binding to mRNA.Alternatively, the C-terminal RG-rich domain alone mayhelp direct essential protein–protein interactions: RGdomains play roles in many protein–protein interactions (4) and physical interactions have been detected between Npl3 and over 70 other proteins in S. cerevisiae , which likely reﬂect both direct interactions and association asmembers of macromolecular complexes ( Saccharomyces Genome Database, http://www.yeastgenome.org).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/f0/3a/gkp349.PMC2715232.pdf
