"Clin Endosc  2017;50:270-278 Key Words:  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; Neurodegenerative diseases; Multiple sclerosis; Parkinson disease; Motor neuron  diseaseOpen Access INTRODUCTION Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been a  recognized method of administration of long-term enteral  feeding since the 1980s.1 The continuity of feeding and aspira - tion rates of PEG compare favorably with those of nasogastric  feeding.2 PEG feeding may be considered if nutritional intake  is expected to be qualitatively or quantitatively inadequate for  a period exceeding 2 to 3 weeks,3 and increases in serum albu -min, a marker of nutritional status, have been demonstrated  after PEG tube placement.4 The potential for PEG as a means of artificial enteral nutri - tion in patients with neurological disease was quickly appre - ciated.5 In these circumstances, dysphagia—with consequent  risk of airway obstruction, dehydration, weight loss, salivary  dribbling, and aspiration pneumonia4—is the most common  indication for artificial enteral nutrition.6 The effort of eating  and time taken to feed during the day may be considerable,  with each mouthful taking 12 to 15 times longer to chew.7  However, prior to insertion of an enteral feeding tube, the  clinical context, diagnosis, prognosis, ethical issues, anticipat - ed effect on quality of life, and the patient’s wishes must be  taken into account.2 Postprocedure morbidity and mortality of PEG tube in - sertion were reported previously, but few studies examined  patients with neurological disease in isolation (Table 1).2,4,5,7-28   The overall complication rate after endoscopic placement Received:  July 22, 2016     Revised:  August 16, 2016   Accepted:  September 9, 2016 Correspondence:  Claire M.

"They can inhibit the synthesis of  carcinoma DNA selectively,8 downregulate P-selectin expression,9 and slow tumor  growth.10 Indoloquinolizines are also the efficient photosensitizers of cancer cells and  thereby are widely used in photodynamic therapy of cancer patients.11,12 The diverse  pharmacological actions led to the recent stereoselective synthesis of a library of  tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinolizines.13 Sugar acids, including glucuronic acid, are  used ubiquitously in detergent and food industries, as well as in the manufacture of  pharmaceutics and cosmetics.14,15 The medicinal utility of glucuronic acid includes  constructing CT DNA intercalator,16,17 constituting a natural heparin-like compound  having low anticoagulant activity,18 and preparing antitumoral delivery systems for  anticancer therapy, in particular.19–25correspondence: Ming Zhao;   shiqi Peng Beijing area Major laboratory of  Peptide and small Molecular Drugs,  engineering research center of  endogenous Prophylactic of Ministry  of education of china, Beijing laboratory  of Biomedical Materials, college of  Pharmaceutical sciences, capital Medical  University, Beijing 100069, People’s  republic of china Tel +86 10 8391 1535;   +86 10 8391 1528 email mingzhao@bjmu.edu.c n;   sqpeng@bjmu.edu.c n Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Xu et al Running head recto: Capability of ATIQCTPC DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S129989",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a0/39/ijn-12-4415.PMC5476604.pdf

"Keywords:  SUN1, lung cancer, proliferation Introduction The Sad-1 and UNC-84 (SUN) domain family, composed of SUN1 and SUN2, is  an important component of nuclear envelope.1,2 Through interaction with Klarsicht,  ANC-1, and Syne/Nesprin homology (KASH) domain proteins, they form the  SUN–KASH protein complexes bridge across the inner nuclear membrane and outer  nuclear membrane.3 The SUN–KASH protein complexes together with emerin and  lamins form a mechanical link between nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton, linker of  the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton complex.4,5 Recently, the structure of this  nuclear envelope complex was widely studied.2,4,6 SUN proteins are localized to the  inner nuclear membrane where they interact with lamins in the nucleoplasm and recruit  KASH proteins to the outer nuclear membrane.1,7 The cytoplasmic domains of KASH  proteins are associated with actin and tubulin cytoskeleton networks.1,8 SUN–KASH protein complexes play important roles in various cellular and  developmental processes, including gametogenesis, neurogenesis, myogenesis, retino - genesis, and ciliogeneisis.1 SUN was first characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans   through molecular analysis of mutant unc-84 , which showed defects in cell nuclear  migration.9,10 Defects in SUN–KASH proteins can result in misposition of nuclei, correspondence: Weiyi huang Department of Oncology, The First  People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai  Jiaotong University, 100 haining  road, shanghai 200080, People’s  republic of china Tel +86 21 3779 8551 Fax +86 21 3779 8551 email weiyihuangdr@163.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Huang et al Running head recto: Role of SUN1 in lung cancer DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S79727",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/76/21/ott-10-2825.PMC5476752.pdf

"“Vasculogenic mimicry” (VM), which was first reported in melanoma in 1999,  refers to tumor cells directly interconnected to form vessel-like channels to transport  blood3 and was found in many other malignant tumors, including ovarian cancer, breast  cancer, prostate cancer, osteosarcoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer,  lung cancer, and hepatocellular cancer.4 VM plays an important role in nourishing  the tumor, forming an extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich network, taking tumor cells  with blood directly into the microcirculation environment and metastasizing to other  organs, and thus playing a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis.5 However, correspondence: Jiandong Zhang Department of radiation Oncology,  Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to  shandong University, 16766 Jingshi road,  Jinan 250014, china Tel +86 135 8312 3486 email zjxblt007@sina.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Zhang et al Running head recto: VM association with increased tumor-infiltrating neutrophils DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S135477",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ca/66/ott-10-2923.PMC5476792.pdf
