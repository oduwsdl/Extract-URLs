"Keywords:  behavioral economics, cognitive function, diabetic nephropathy, economic status,  income Introduction The standard treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is dietary therapy and  appropriate exercise, followed by the sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic  agents, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or insulin injection (basal and/or  mealtime).1 Large prospective clinical studies have shown a strong relationship between  hyperglycemia and diabetic microvascular complications in both type 1 diabetes  mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM.2,3 However, modification of lifestyle habits, as well as  adherence to pharmacological treatment, proves to be challenging in many patients.4,5  It remains unclear why many patients with diabetes cannot make the necessary lifestyle  changes and cannot adhere to pharmacological treatment, both of which are clearly  beneficial for their future health.correspondence: naoya emoto Department of endocrinology, nippon  Medical School Chiba-Hokusoh Hospital,  1715 Kamagari, Inzai-shi, Chiba   270-1694, Japan email n-emoto@nms.ac.j p Journal name: Patient Preference and Adherence Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Emoto et al Running head recto: Educational attainment and diabetic retinopathy DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S116198",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/c7/23/ppa-10-2151.PMC5087708.pdf

"Keywords:  child abuse, cigarette, smoking, physical abuse, sexual abuse, intimate partner  violence, domestic violence, family violence Introduction COPD refers to a group of debilitating and degenerative diseases of the lungs including  emphysema and chronic bronchitis.1,2 In Canada, COPD is a leading cause of hospital  admissions among major chronic illnesses and has a high readmission rate, placing a  significant strain on the health care system.3 Although cigarette smoking is the underlying cause of COPD in 80%–90% of cases,  environmental factors such as occupational exposure to dusts and fumes, exposure to  secondhand smoke, and air pollution may play a role in the development and prognosis  of COPD.1,2,4 In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that disease suffered in  adulthood may originate from adversities experienced in childhood, supporting a life  course framework to better understand the determinants of chronic disease.5–7 Childhood  adversities (including childhood maltreatment [CM]) are related to various physical  chronic conditions in adulthood.8–12 Although associations between CM and COPD  have rarely been studied, recent research provides evidence of a possible link.7,13,14 The life course approach posits that there are multiple pathways underlying the asso - ciations between CM and disease in adulthood.5–7 Since CM has been shown to predict Correspondence: Wendy E Hovdestad Public Health Agency of Canada,  Seventh Floor, 785 Carling Avenue,  Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada Tel +1 613 799 0921 Fax +1 613 960 0944 email w endy.hovdestad@phac-aspc.gc.c a Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Shields et al Running head recto: Childhood maltreatment and COPD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S107549",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/6b/c2/copd-11-2641.PMC5087754.pdf

"miRNA can cause mRNAs degradation or  translational suppression by directly binding to the 3 ′-untranslated regions of mRNAs.4,5  In cancer biology, the dysfunction of miRNA expression has been associated with tumor  occurrence, progression, and development.6–9 miR-32 is an miRNA that works very dif - ferently in several types of cancers – while it is significantly decreased in certain cancers  such as gastric cancer and osteosarcoma,10,11 it is upregulated in a variety of other cancers  such as colorectal cancer,12 kidney cancer,13 and prostate cancer.14 In particular, miR-32  is overexpressed and associated with pathogenesis in MM diseases.15 By global miRNA  expression profiling of cancer cells from MM patients, a variety of miRNAs such as  miR-21, miR-106b cluster, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-32, and miR-17 cluster are found  to be upregulated in MM patients.15–17 We, therefore, are interested in investigating the  expression of miR-32 in a variety of MM patients from a clinical perspective.correspondence: linjun Yang Department of surgical Oncology,  Taizhou Municipal hospital,  no.381 east road of Zhongshan,  Jiaojiang District, Taizhou city, 318000  Zhejiang, People’s republic of china Tel +86 576 8885 8000 email yanglinjun2008@126.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Hua et al Running head recto: Dysfunction of microRNA-32 regulates ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 in MM DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S105945",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/29/92/ott-9-6573.PMC5087813.pdf

"Keywords:  denture repair, flexural strength, impact strength, PMMA, ZrO2 nanoparticles Introduction Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is the most common denture base material due to  its biocompatibility, esthetics, accurate fit, stability in the oral environment, ease of  fabrication and adjustment, low cost, and possibility of repair.1,2 However, PMMA  has poor mechanical properties, which often results in denture base fractures.3 Such  denture fractures may occur inside the patient’s mouth usually at the midline of the  denture base during mastication or outside the patient’s mouth when the removable  prosthesis drops suddenly.4–6correspondence: Mohammed M gad Department of substitutive Dental  sciences, college of Dentistry, University  of Dammam, PO Box 1982, Dammam  31441, saudi arabia Tel +966 5 9250 2080 Fax +966 13 857 2624 email dr.gad@hotmail.co m Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Gad et al Running head recto: Effects of incorporation of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the strength of PMMA DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S120054",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/33/37/ijn-11-5633.PMC5089829.pdf
