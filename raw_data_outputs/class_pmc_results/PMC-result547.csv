"Keywords:  COPD, chronic kidney disease, Charlson comorbidity index, mortality,  comorbidity Introduction COPD is one of the major causes of death ranking fourth worldwide, and it is predicted  to become the third leading cause by 2030 ( http://www.who.int/healthinfo /),1 making  this disease one of the major health challenges.2 The best way to reduce the prevalence of COPD is to control for risk factors;  although it is generally accepted that smoking is an important determinant of the dis - ease, other variables can contribute to its burden3 and several comorbidities contribute  to the overall severity.4 COPD is associated with increased overall mortality compared with the general  population.5 Frequent acute exacerbations also play an important role in decreased  lung function and thereby increase disease severity and mortality.6,7 COPD is associated with several comorbid conditions such as ischemic heart disease,  arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, diabetes, lung cancer, osteoporosis, and depression.8,9 Correspondence: Fabio Fabbian Department of Medical sciences, Clinica  Medica Unit, school of Medicine,  University of Ferrara, University hospital  of Ferrara, Via aldo Moro 8, Ferrara  I-44124, Italy Tel +39 0532 23 7071 Fax +39 0532 23 6816 email f.fabbian@ospfe.i t Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Fedeli et al Running head recto: Lung and kidney: a dangerous liaison?",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b8/7e/copd-12-443.PMC5291454.pdf

"Keywords:  CNS, BBB, nasal mucosa, grafting, lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replace - ment therapies Introduction There are more than 1,000 agents which are active on central nervous system (CNS)  pathologies that have shown promising perspectives in preclinical studies but failed  to show good results in the later phases of the development process (at Phase III or  even after registration).1–5 For this reason, disorders of the CNS represent one of the largest areas of unsatis - fied medical needs, with about 2 billion people affected worldwide and many pharma  companies moving away from such fields of innovative research because of the high  risk of failure associated with CNS medicines, together with the ever increasing  approval time.6,7 One of the major reasons for the poor translation of neuroscience research into  medicines is the high degree of complexity of the human CNS, and effective nonin - vasive treatment of neurological diseases is often limited by the very limited access  of therapeutic agents into the CNS owing to the presence of two anatomical and bio - chemical dynamic barriers: the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–cerebrospinal  fluid barrier (BCSFB).8 It is already well known that BBB is formed by endothelial cells (ECs), which line  up in capillaries of the brain and spinal cord by a variety of pericytes, vascular smooth  muscle cells, astrocytes, and microglia.9 The BBB, composed of densely packed cells Correspondence: Maria Carafa Department of Drug Chemistry and  Technology, University of Rome  “Sapienza”, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5,   00185 Rome, italy Tel +39 06 4991 3603 Fax +39 06 4991 3133 email maria.carafa@uniroma1.i t Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Marianecci et al Running head recto: Nasal mucosal grafting: potential for drug delivery to the CNS DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S100075",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/04/0a/dddt-11-325.PMC5291459.pdf

"Keywords:  metastatic pancreatic cancer, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, Western Europe, MPACT Introduction Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe, with  mortality nearly equaling incidence.1,2 The overall 5-year survival rate for patients  with pancreatic cancer is approximately 7%–8%.3,4 Fewer than 20% of patients have  resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis, and most patients present with metastatic  disease.5 The major objectives of treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer  are to palliate symptoms, control disease progression, and increase survival time.6,7 Three Phase III trials have demonstrated longer overall survival (OS) with inves - tigational treatment regimens vs gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line treatment  for advanced pancreatic cancer.8–10 The combination of erlotinib plus gemcitabine correspondence: Josep Tabernero Medical Oncology Department, Vall  d’hebron University hospital, Vall  d’hebron institute of Oncology (VhiO),  P.

"Keywords:  restricting-type anorexia nervosa, adolescence, parental bonding instrument, inter - generational transmission, latent class analysis, care and overprotection Introduction To date, there is a wide literature focusing on the attachment theory1 as a possible  framework for understanding anorexia nervosa origin, course and treatment response.2–4  Despite the increasing evidences of dysfunctional family relations and insecure style  of attachment in eating-disordered patients,5–7 literature data are contradictory and  limited by a wide variety of methodological approaches.8 To summarize the findings regarding attachment in eating disorders (EDs), it is  worth noticing that insecure attachment (dismissing or preoccupied types) is frequent  among patients with EDs: in particular, avoidant attachment tends to be more repre - sented in patients with restricting anorexia, while patients with bulimia show a higher  prevalence of attachment preoccupation.8 On the whole, patients with EDs often report  problems with childhood family relationships,8 but the precise nature of the problems  and the mechanism underlying their connection with EDs are rather unclear, since  findings from scientific literature appear to be still inconclusive.3,8,9correspondence: stefania Mannarini interdepartmental center for Family  research, Department of Philosophy,  sociology, education, and applied  Psychology, section of applied  Psychology, University of Padova,  Via Venezia 14, 35131 Padova, italy Tel +39 49 827 6630 Fax +39 49 827 6600 email stefania.mannarini@unipd.i t Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 13 Running head verso: Balottin et al Running head recto: The PBI in families of adolescents with anorexia DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S128418",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/89/38/ndt-13-319.PMC5295792.pdf
