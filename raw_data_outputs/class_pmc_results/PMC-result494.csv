"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an umbrella term that encompasses  pathologically distinct subtypes including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma,  large-cell carcinoma, and more poorly differentiated variants, constitutes 85% of all  lung cancers with the adenocarcinoma subtype .50% of all lung cancers.2,3 Platinum-based doublet chemotherapies have proved among the most efficacious of  chemotherapeutic combinations.4,5 However, various other combinations of cytotoxic  chemotherapies have not led to better outcomes.4 In selective cases, though, certain  molecularly targeted therapies have led to superior outcomes compared to standard  chemotherapy in NSCLC.3,5 Gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib is recommended as first- line therapy for patients with sensitive mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR).6,7 Similarly, crizotinib is recommended as first-line treatment for patients who  harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) gene rearrangement, and it can additionally  be considered in first line or later treatment of patients with activated ROS1 proto- oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase ( ROS1 , activated by chromosomal rearrangement  of a portion of ROS1 with one of 12 different partner proteins).6,7 These targeted  therapies have led to superior outcomes including survival benefits as compared to  standard chemotherapy.8–11 Bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic agent, has also shown  benefit in certain patient populations.12 Despite these targeted therapies, prolonged disease control and long-term survival  outcomes continue to evade.5,7 Furthermore, only a small fraction of NSCLC patients Correspondence: Hongbin Chen Department of Medicine, Roswell Park  Cancer institute, elm and Carlton Streets,  Buffalo, NY 14263, USA Tel +1 716 845 3099 Fax +1 716 845 8935 email hongbin.chen@roswellpark.or g Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Vachhani and Chen Running head recto: Pembrolizumab in NSCLC DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S97746",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/da/e1/ott-9-5855.PMC5045223.pdf

"Keywords:  photodynamic therapy, photosensitizer, pyropheophorbide- a, nanoparticle Introduction Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a highly localized and tumor-specific modality, has  been shown to treat cancers.1 Compared to conventional cancer-treatment modalities,  including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and more recently immunotherapy,2  PDT has the advantages of extremely low systemic toxicity, minimal invasiveness,  excellent function-sparing, and tolerance of repeated therapy without cumulative  toxicity.3–5 Essentially, it involves the administration of a photosensitizer (PS) fol - lowed by photoexcitation to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as  singlet oxygen (1O2), which irreversibly ablate tumor cells without damaging healthy  ones.4,6 PDT can also induce immune responses and thus contribute to long-term tumor  control,4 and can be used as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the residual tumor burden  following surgical resection of tumors.7 Additionally, PDT agents have the potential  to act as multifunctional theranostic agents to achieve simultaneous monitoring and  therapeutic capabilities during cancer treatment.8,9 For these reasons, PDT has emerged  as an important therapeutic option in the management of cancers, such as early lung  cancer,10 Barrett’s esophagus,11 bladder cancer,12 head and neck cancers,13 skin cancer,14  and bronchial cancers.15 The essential element for effective PDT is an ideal PS, the lack of which continues  to be a major roadblock restricting the clinical utility of PDT as a first-line treatment  option.16 An ideal PS must be able to generate singlet oxygen efficiently upon activation  with longer-wavelength light (650–900 nm) for deeper light penetration.17 Most impor - tantly, it must preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues and be rapidly cleared from correspondence: Zhangyong hong;  Zhinan Yin state Key laboratory of Medicinal  chemical Biology, college of life   sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin   road, Tianjin 300071, People’s   republic of china Tel/fax +86 21 2349 8707 email hongzy@nankai.edu.c n;   zhinan.yin@yale.ed u Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Liu et al Running head recto: Photodynamic therapy of tumors with nanoparticles DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S112541",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/4c/ca/ijn-11-4905.PMC5045903.pdf

"Keywords:  diffuse axonal injury, magnesium sulfate, outcome Introduction Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is one of the most common and severe types of traumatic  brain injury (TBI) after vehicle accidents.1 When screening all forms of TBI, it has  been confirmed that 60% of all severe and 30% of moderate brain injury victims are  associated with DAI.2 It has been proven that severe DAI can cause an increased  incidence of morbidity, mortality, and development of a persistent vegetative state.3,4  The severity of injury is typically more in younger than older people but the outcomes  are worse in the elderly.5 Brain ischemic damage as a result of secondary brain injury is extremely common  in the later period following TBI, with 80% to 90% of the victims showing evidence  of ischemic brain damage by histopathological examinations.6,7 Recently, researchers  observed that an ultra-early period of severe reduction in brain blood flow occurs  within 6 hours after the initial insult in one-third of the patients with severe TBI.7 Correspondence: Xiang-Dong guan Department of Critical Care Medicine,  The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat- sen University, no 58, the second Road  of Zhongshan Road, 239000, guangzhou,  guangdong, People’s Republic of China Tel +86 20 8733 1008 Fax +86 20 8733 1008 email 13727021051@sina.c n Journal name: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Zhao et al Running head recto: The effects of magnesium sulfate therapy DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S109482",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ef/0b/tcrm-12-1481.PMC5045904.pdf

"Keywords:  melatonin, hypoxia, use, encephalopathy Introduction Perinatal asphyxia is defined as the interference of gas exchange or blood flow to  and from the fetus in the perinatal age.1 This interruption could be extended to partial  asphyxia and sudden subtotal asphyxia because of a sentry experience or a combi - nation of both.2 Hypoxic-ischemic injuries to the brain might be the outcome if the  perinatal asphyxia is of an adequate intensity or extended beyond the capability of  the fetus to compensate.3,4 Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) affects one to three per 1,000  live full-term births.5,6 Up to one-fifth of the affected newborns will perish in the  postnatal period, and a further 25% will develop severe and permanent neuropsy - chological sequelae, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental retardation, and visual  motor or visual perceptive dysfunction.7 Ensuing a hypoxic-ischemic (HI) abuse, an  instantaneous phase of neuronal cell injury and enervation of energy stores occurs,  followed by oxidative stress and apoptosis.8 Many crucial neuronal groups are more  susceptible to HI injury in newborns than in adults, especially those related to enhanced  density and function of excitatory amino acid receptors.9 The neonatal brain has  higher water content, underdeveloped cortex, lower myelin, and a more conspicuous  germinal matrix than the mature brain.10 The morbidity and mortality of infants are  strongly affected by their ability to preserve physiologic homeostasis.11 Melatonin  has begun to be contemplated as a good choice in order to diminish the neurological Correspondence: mohamed a Hendaus Department of Pediatrics, Section of  academic General Pediatrics, Hamad  medical Corporation, Po Box 3050,  Doha, Qatar Tel +974 4439 2239 Fax +974 4443 9571 email mhendaus@yahoo.co m Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Commentary Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Hendaus et al Running head recto: Melatonin in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S115533",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ae/1d/ndt-12-2473.PMC5045913.pdf
