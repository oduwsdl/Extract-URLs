"Keywords:  mesoporous calcium–silicon xerogels, pore size, pore volume, load-release,  rhBMP-2 Introduction Mesoporous materials with pores ranging in size from 2 to 50 nm have received  enormous attention owing to their potential applications in catalysis, separation, sensing,  drug delivery, enzyme immobilization, and so on.1–2 So far, some studies have reported  the design of drug delivery systems based on the mesoporous materials for therapeutic  molecules, including chemical drugs, peptides and proteins, and so on.3–5 As an effec - tive molecule-delivering vector, the mesoporous materials with the pore size of a few  nanometers have a high capacity to encapsulate large amounts of molecules.4,6 More - over, the pore size, pore volume, and microstructure of the mesoporous materials can  be adjusted according to the size and performances of delivered molecules.6,7 Recently,  the application of mesoporous materials for bone regeneration has been proposed, and  the tunable pore size and high pore volume of the mesoporous materials might allow  them to load osteogenic agents and promote new bone tissue regeneration.6,8 The biomacromolecule bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) with strong bone- inducing activity has been considered to play important roles in bone regeneration.9–11  Furthermore, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) has correspondence: guoyu lv; Jie Wei sichuan University, No 24 south  section 1, Yihuan road, chengdu 610065,  People's republic of china; east china  University of science and Technology,  130 Meilong road, shanghai 200237,  People's republic of china Tel +86 21 64251308 Fax +86 21 64251358 email nic7505@263.ne t;   jiewei7860@sina.co m Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Song et al Running head recto: Mesoporous calcium–silicon xerogels DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S70934",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/60/08/ijn-10-1715.PMC4356665.pdf

"Keywords:  COPD, videofluoroscopy, oral–pharyngeal transit, swallowing, deglutition Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disorder characterized by chronic  obstruction of the pulmonary airflow, with little variation in time and slow progression,  associated with an inflammatory response to environmental particles or gases, in par - ticular to cigarette smoke.1 The limitation of the expiratory flow is compensated greatly  by an increase in the work of respiratory muscles, particularly those activated during  inspiration.2 The patients have a limited ventilatory capacity with increased respiratory  frequency during rest and poor exercise tolerance mainly due to dyspnea.1 Respiration and swallowing are related and coordinated to reach a safe transit of  food through the pharynx.3 The loss of respiration–swallowing coordination may cause  dysphagia, aspiration, pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, decrease in quality of  life, and death.4 Some studies have shown that patients with COPD may have swallowing  dysfunction, with the possibility of airway penetration and aspiration.5–7 Abnormal  swallowing reflex frequently occurs and predisposes patients to disease exacerbations.8  Patients with COPD have a longer than expected apnea during the oral–pharyngeal Correspondence: roberto Oliveira  Dantas Department of Medicine, Medical school  of ribeirão Preto, University of são  Paulo, 14049-900, ribeirão Preto, são  Paulo, Brazil Tel +55 16 3602 2457 Fax +55 16 3602 0229 email rodantas@fmrp.usp.b r Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Cassiani et al Running head recto: Swallowing in COPD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S74945",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/57/10/copd-10-489.PMC4356708.pdf
