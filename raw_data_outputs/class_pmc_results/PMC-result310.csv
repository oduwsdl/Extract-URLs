"Keywords:  bone, osteoporosis, tocotrienol, vitamin E Introduction The skeletal system undergoes a constant remodeling process governed by bone cells,  ie, osteoblasts for bone formation, osteoclasts for bone resorption, and osteocytes for  mechanosensing and mediation of bone remodeling.1 An imbalance in bone remodeling,  whereby the rate of bone resorption is faster than bone formation, will result in osteo - porosis.2 Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease suffered by both men and women.3  The hallmark of osteoporosis is the degeneration of bone density and microarchitecture,  leading to bone fragility and fracture.4 The prevalence of osteoporosis as reflected by  fragility fracture is higher in women than in men, with a 6:1 ratio of women to men.3  However, the mortality rate post-fracture is higher in men compared to their female  counterparts.5,6 The major cause of osteoporosis in women is estrogen deficiency due  to menopause, while in men it is late-onset testosterone deficiency.7,8 Other causes  of osteoporosis include prolonged use of glucocorticoid, chronic smoking, alcohol  abuse, inflammatory bowel syndrome, celiac disease, immobility, and the use of drugs  affecting the skeletal system.9 Osteoporosis causes a significant economic burden to  society due to loss of productivity and the high cost of treatment.3,10 The current therapies for osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and  strontium ranelate, are effective in increasing bone mineral density of the patients and  reducing fractures, with rare cases of adverse side effects.11 They are indicated for  patients over 50 years old with a hip or vertebral fracture, osteoporosis, or osteopenia  determined by bone mineral density and a high fracture probability.9 The commonly  prescribed preventive agents, ie, calcium and vitamin D, have been found to be effective Correspondence: Soelaiman ima-Nirwana Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of  Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latif,   56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Tel +6 03 9145 5002 Fax +6 03 9145 6633 email imasoel@ppukm.ukm.edu.m y Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Chin and Ima-Nirwana Running head recto: Tocotrienol and bone DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S79660",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/d7/81/dddt-9-2049.PMC4396581.pdf

"Large clinical trials  have confirmed their usefulness for preventing cardiovascular events by lowering blood  pressure and having an antioxidant effect on vessels in vitro.3,4 CCBs primarily inhibit calcium influx through the L-type voltage-dependent calcium  channels at the level of vascular smooth muscle, thereby disrupting the excitation– contraction process.5,6 However, as these CCBs interfere in the transportation of calcium  through cell membranes, they may affect many metabolic processes, including bone  metabolism.7,8 A number of clinical and experimental studies have reported that the  effects of CCBs are associated with skeletal calcium metabolism due to the presence of  L-type calcium channels in osteoblastic cells.9 Regulators of bone formation modulate  the channel’s expression, suggesting a functional involvement of L-type calcium chan - nels in bone remodeling.10 AML is a third generation dihydropyridine L-type CCB used  in the treatment of angina pectoris, arterial hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias.11correspondence: Yusuf atalay Department of Oral and Maxillofacial  surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, afyon   Kocatepe University, 03030  afyonkarahisar, Turkey Tel +90 272 216 7900-1038-1025 email dratalay@aku.edu.t r Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Atalay et al Running head recto: Effects of amlodipine on bone healing DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S80778",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/68/a3/dddt-9-1973.PMC4396585.pdf

"Functional autoantibodies against the high-affinity  immunoglobulin E receptor (Fc εRI) or immunoglobulin E (IgE)  found in a subset of CU patients can activate and degranulate  mast cells; however, the absence of autoantibodies in other CU  populations indicate other potential causes of CU.4 Recently, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22  (PTPN22 ), a strong susceptible gene for various autoimmune  diseases, is found to be associated with CU.5 PTPN22  gene is lo - cated on chromosome 1p13.3-p13.1 and encodes the lymphoid  protein tyrosine phosphatase (Lyp) which is a negative regula - tor of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling.6 PTPN22  gene  polymorphism (1858C >T) impairs T-cell signaling and may in -fluence autoimmune mechanisms and promote proinflamma - tory responses.7 Additionally, a correlation has been found be - tween T-cell activation and mast cell degranulation in CU pa - tients that indicate the role of T cells in CU pathogenesis.8 Superantigens are exotoxins produced by microorganisms  that can activate a widerange of T cells.9 Superantigens, partic - ularly produced by Staphylococcus aureus  (SA), such as staphy - lococcal enterotoxins (SE) A, SEB, and toxic shock syndrome  toxin-1 (TSST-1), have been associated with various inflamma - tory diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and pso - riasis.10-12 Staphylococcal superantigens can activate T cells that  result in the production of IgE and IgG antibodies from B cells.13  In addition, staphylococcal superantigens have been shown to  induce inflammation via the production of serum specific IgE  to superantigens in patients with AD.14 Specific IgE antibodies Association Between PTPN22  Polymorphisms and IgE Responses to  Staphylococcal Superantigens in Chronic Urticaria Sailesh Palikhe,1,2 Seung-Hyun Kim,2 Le Duy Pham,1,2 Young-Min Ye,1 Hae-Sim Park1,2* 1Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea 2Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits  unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/70/db/aair-7-290.PMC4397370.pdf

"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjopt.2014.09.004 Introduction Pathological Myopia (PM) is a common cause of visual deterioration worldwide.1,2It is estimated to be prevalent at a rate of 2–4% in West European populations and 9–21% in East Asian populations.1Rates of PM are increasing world- wide due to a variety of factors including a significant reduc- tion in the number of hours children spend outdoors.2,3PM can be defined as either: a refractive error of /C06 dioptres or an axial length of 26.5 mm.4Typically, its pathogenesis is associated with progressive and excessive elongation of the eyeball, leading to degenerative changes in the choroid,sclera and retina.1Visual impairment caused by PM often occurs in the young to middle-aged, therefore amplifying the socioeconomic impacts of this disease.1 The natural course of PM varies amongst individuals, lead- ing to a variation in visual deterioration.5However, without treatment visual prognosis is generally very poor.5–8Degener- ative changes that may occur with pathological myopia include: posterior staphyloma, diffuse or patchy chorioretinalatrophy, retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, lacquer cracks,spontaneous subretinal haemorrhages and macular choroidal neovascularisation (CNV).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b1/2d/main.PMC4398811.pdf

"Keywords:  auditory impairment, verbal function, aging, cognition Introduction The prevalence of hearing loss in older adults is very high, with up to 30% of men  and 20% of women by the age of 70 years and 55% of men and 45% of women over   80 years presenting hearing loss of at least 30 decibels of hearing level (dB HL).1 This  age-related hearing loss first affects higher tones.2 When mild, it leads to problems  following conversations in noisy and reverberant listening situations, progressing to  difficulties following any conversation as it becomes more severe, due to problems  with the discrimination of words and even voice identification.2,3 Sensory deficits, including hearing loss, are considered one of the major geriatric  syndromes because of the important negative impact they generate on individual  emotional, physical, and social levels.4–6 In fact, hearing loss has been associated  with depressive symptoms,7 impaired communication and social relationships,8 and  increased difficulty in activities of daily living.9 Despite the negative functional, psychological, and social consequences of hear - ing loss,10,11 its effects on intellectual/cognitive functioning is not completely clear,  although it has been previously discussed.12–16Correspondence: José Carlos Millán- Calenti gerontology research group,  Department of Medicine, Faculty  of health sciences, University of A  Coruña, Campus de A Coruña, 15071  A Coruña,  spain Tel +34 981 167 000 ext 5865 Fax +34 981 167 120 email jcmillan@udc.e s Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Lodeiro-Fernández et al Running head recto: Hearing loss and language impairment DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S81260",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/3e/0c/cia-10-695.PMC4399695.pdf
