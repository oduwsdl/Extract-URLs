"IL-27  not only exhibits antitumor immune activity via cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural  killer cells but also shows an antiangiogenic effect against melanoma.3 The antitumor  activity of IL-27 in a murine model of colon carcinoma has been shown to be mediated  through CD8+ T-cells with enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity.4 IL-27 plays an  important role in the antitumor activity against lung cancer by inhibiting epithelial– mesenchymal transition and angiogenic factor production via a STAT1-dominant  pathway and/or suppressing cyclooxygenase-2-mediated activities.5–8 Recently, polymorphisms in the IL-27  gene have been evaluated in patients with  nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.9–11 To date, correspondence: gangfeng Xiao Department of hematology and  Oncology, ningbo no 2 hospital, ningbo  Medical University, no 41 Xibei street,  ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, People’s  republic of china Tel +86 574 8387 0268 email xiaogangfeng123@163.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Ge and Xiao Running head recto: IL-27 polymorphism in NSCLC patient DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S93226",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/09/80/ott-9-895.PMC4770075.pdf

"Opioid consumption during the postoperative period was measured in terms of morphine equivalents, which were calculated using the analgesic-specific conver- sion factor from http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.cgi.16 For example, a nontolerant subject taking 1 tablet orally of 10 mg hydrocodone would be equivalent to 10 oral morphine equivalents (mEq) (50 mgf e n t a n y l ¼15 mEq; 5 mg oxycodone ¼7.5 mEq).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/37/04/10.1177_2325967116631335.PMC4772345.pdf

"Keywords:  antenatal depression, pregnant women, exercise Introduction Many physical changes, as well as emotional disturbance, occur during pregnancy.1  In addition to external physical changes, some mental health problems such as depres - sion and psychosis significantly increase during pregnancy and in the immediate  postnatal period.2 Subtle changes experienced by pregnant women can transform their  ability to carry out their normal roles and may affect their quality of life, even if the  pregnancy is normal.1 Major depressive disorder (MDD) during pregnancy is neither uncommon nor benign,  and its prevalence is estimated as 10%–13%.3 However, women who live in low- and  middle-income countries are more vulnerable to both ante- and post-natal depression.4  An African study estimated an antenatal depression prevalence rate of 35%–50%.5 In  Egypt, it was found that a significant proportion of pregnant women ( ~60%) experience  prenataldepression.6,7 Studies found that pre- and perinatal complications such as premature  labor, low birth weight, poor self-care, compromised mother–child bonding, and longer  hospital stay are increased in subjects with depression and prenatal stress.8,9 Antenatal  depression is also a strong predictor of postnatal depression; a previous study reported that  symptoms in many women with postpartum depression started during pregnancy.10correspondence: ghada Khafagy Department of Family Medicine, Faculty  of Medicine, cairo University, giza,  egypt, 71st, Moez el-Dwla, Makram  ebeed, nasr city, cairo 11727, egypt Tel +20 100 639 3140 email ghada.khafagy@kasralainy.edu.e gJournal name: International Journal of Women’s Health Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 8 Running head verso: El-Rafie et al Running head recto: Effect of exercise on antenatal depression DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S94112",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/02/4f/ijwh-8-053.PMC4772941.pdf
