"Strengths and limitations Strengths of the research included the importance of pro- viding guidelines for interpreting research using these com- monly used measures; the use of a prenatal tobaccoexposure at Pittsburgh and an adolescent-emerging adult cohort at Oregon; and the lengthy time intervals between the initial research and the administration of the LTUQ.Limitations, which may have inﬂuenced the strength ofthe associations, related to differences in question wording from the initial testing to the subsequent LTUQ testing (Web Table 1; http://aje.oupjournals.org); differences in the modeof completion (initial in-person interview and telephone in- terview); lack of a deﬁnitive gold standard for establishing validity of the LTUQ; and possible bias related to nonre-sponse of initial participants, which could result in an over- estimate of the level of agreement.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/48/71/kwq179.PMC2945825.pdf
