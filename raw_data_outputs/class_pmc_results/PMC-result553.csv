"Keywords:  cationic liposome, nanoparticle, vaccine, cross-presentation, lysosome Introduction Cationic liposomes (CLs), composed of positively charged lipids, have received  extensive attention as vaccine delivery vehicles.1–5 Wide interest in CLs stems from  their unique attributes, including their abilities to form nanocomplexes with anionic  plasmid DNAs, peptides, and proteins;1,2 to prolong antigen release at the site of  injection (ie, depot effect);6,7 to induce uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)  mediated by their ionic interaction with negatively charged cellular membranes;1,8  and to allow the simultaneous delivery of antigen and adjuvant molecules to APCs,  including B-cells, for the induction of IgG responses.9–11 Importantly, CLs can also  enhance antigen cross-presentation12,13 – the process by which APCs phagocytose  extracellular protein antigens, process them intracellularly into peptide epitopes, and  present them in the context of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) on the correspondence: Jie gao Department of Pharmaceutical sciences,  school of Pharmacy, second Military  Medical University, 325 guohe road,  shanghai 200433, People’s republic  of china email gaojie@smmu.edu.c n  James J Moon Department of Pharmaceutical sciences,  University of Michigan, ann arbor,  MI, Usa email moonjj@umich.ed u Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Gao et al Running head recto: CLs promote antigen cross-presentation DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S125866",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/40/df/ijn-12-1251.PMC5317250.pdf
