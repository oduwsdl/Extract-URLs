"Keywords:  interleukin-1 inhibitor, AoSD, anakinra, adverse events, clinical and laboratory  parameters, efficacy Introduction Adult-onset Still disease (AoSD) is a rare multisystemic inflammatory disorder  manifested by a variety of clinical features, including high, spiking fever, evanescent  skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, polyarthritis, and other systemic  symptoms.1,2 The pathogenesis of AoSD is currently unclear,3 and the therapeutic  strategies of AoSD can be varied according to its clinical presentation.4–6 Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids are commonly used as first- line agents for AoSD,7,8 and if first-line treatment is ineffective, disease-modifying  antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate are added.9 Corticosteroids can  control the manifestations of AoSD in about 65% of patients,10 and the response to  corticosteroids is often quick, within a few hours.11,12 However, corticosteroids easily  induce dependence – steroid dependence occurred in 42% of the cases in one study.13 Correspondence: Xingguo Zhang Department of Pharmacy, the First  Affiliated Hospital of College of Medicine,  Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road,  Hangzhou 310003, People’s Republic  of China Tel +86 571 8723 3003 Fax +86 571 8723 3003 email hdswell@zju.edu.c nJournal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2014 Volume: 8 Running head verso: Hong et al Running head recto: Interleukin 1 inhibition with anakinra in adult-onset Still disease DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S73428",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/1d/4c/dddt-8-2345.PMC4251663.pdf
