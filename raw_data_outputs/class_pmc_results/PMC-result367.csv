"Keywords:  titania nanotubes, macrophage, mitogen-activated protein kinases, NF- κB,  inflammatory mediators Introduction The influence of surface topography in modulating macrophage activity is well known,  and it takes place through the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways  involved in the foreign body reaction, which in turn, will lead to the expression of  inflammatory cytokine genes.1–3 Among the existing signaling pathways, mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of  activated B cells (NF- κB) signaling pathways are key regulators of the inflammatory  processes.4,5 These pathways are known to be involved in the pro-inflammatory mediator  expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), having a critical role in the regulation  of cellular growth and differentiation as well as in controlling the cell behavior toward  cytokines and stress stimuli.6 LPS-evoked signaling leads to the activation of these  signal transduction pathways, in either a myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent correspondence: anisoara cimpean Department of Biochemistry and  Molecular Biology, University of  Bucharest, 91-95 Splaiul Independentei,  050095 Bucharest, Romania Tel +40 21 318 1575 email anisoara.cimpean@bio.unibuc.r o Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Neacsu et al Running head recto: Attenuation of macrophage inflammatory activity by titania nanotubes DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S92019",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/78/8d/ijn-10-6455.PMC4608594.pdf

"Keywords:  chronic lung disease, nonproductive cough, WTC cough syndrome, posttraumatic  stress disorder, Veterans Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable chronic condition  best characterized by measurable, nonreversible restrictions in air flow with repeated,  intermittent exacerbation of symptoms generally manifested by shortness of breath,  nonproductive cough, sensations of air hunger, and reduced capacity for physical  activity.1 It is the third leading cause of mortality in the USA, with a prevalence  estimate approximately 9%–10%.2–4 COPD also contributes to substantial direct and  indirect costs to both patients and systems of care.1Correspondence: Thad e Abrams Iowa City vA Health System  (Mailstop 152), 601 Hwy 6 west,  Iowa City, IA 52246, USA Tel +1 319 338 0581 ext 7700 Fax +1 319 887 4932 email t had.abrams@va.go v Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Abrams et al Running head recto: Chronic obstructive lung disease and posttraumatic stress disorder DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S71449",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/77/d2/copd-10-2219.PMC4610806.pdf

"In protein synthesis, aaRSs catalyze the assembly of amino acids to their  respective tRNAs and play an important role in the maintenance of cell survival.6,7  These enzymes have also been shown to be promising targets in the development of  antimicrobial agents8 as well as in therapeutics against cancers and other diseases.9,10  Leucine is the most important amino acid in nutrients sensing through uncharged  leucine-specific tRNA,11 and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS) is reported to be over - expressed in lung cancer cells.12 The gene of LARS is homozygously amplified in 17%  of kidney renal cell carcinoma and mutated/amplified in approximately 4% of malig - nant peripheral nerve sheet tumor, melanoma, and small cell lung carcinoma.13 Also,  this homozygously expressed gene was deleted in 3% of acute myeloid leukemia.14  In addition, overexpressed mitochondrial LARS suppresses the A3243G mutation,  which causes a number of human diseases, including tumorigenesis.15,16 LARS-targeted correspondence: Dawei li; huchen Zhou school of Pharmacy, shanghai Jiao  Tong University, 800 Dongchuan road,  Minhang District, shanghai 200240,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 21 3420 4744 Fax +86 21 3420 5436 email daweili@sjtu.edu.c n; hczhou@sjtu.edu.c n Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 8 Running head verso: Gao et al Running head recto: hsLARS as an anticancer target DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S88873",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/51/58/ott-8-2933.PMC4610879.pdf
