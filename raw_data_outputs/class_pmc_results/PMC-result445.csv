"Keywords:  dementia, hyperphagia, spaced retrieval training, Montessori-based activities,  longitudinal research Introduction The prevalence of hyperphagia in patients with dementia is ∼23%–51% and tends to  occur in patients in the middle stage of dementia.1,2 The main features of hyperphagia  include increased appetite (eg, frequent food searches or requests for food), faster eating  speed, and increased amount of food consumed.1,3,4 Hyperphagia is usually complicated  with altered eating habits, inadequate eating behaviors, and pica; this may easily lead  to risks of upper airway obstruction, nutritional imbalance, or poisoning caused by  erroneous eating and also increase the conflicts between caregivers and patients.4–8 The literature shows that the hyperphagic behaviors of patients with dementia  may originate from damage to the frontotemporal lobe or an impaired satiety center Correspondence: li-Chan lin Institute of Clinical nursing, national  Yang-Ming University, 155, li-nong  street, sec 2, Taipei, Taiwan,  republic of China Tel/fax +886 2 2826 7159 email lichan2009@gmail.co m Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Kao et al Running head recto: Effectiveness of different memory training programs DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S102027",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/02/00/cia-11-707.PMC4887047.pdf

"Keywords:  osteosarcoma, microRNA-200b, proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis Introduction Osteosarcoma is the most common type of cancer that develops in bone, mainly arising  from the metaphysis of the long bones.1 Despite the development of cancer treatment  over the past few decades, the prognosis of advanced osteosarcoma still remains poor,  mainly due to its resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and adjuvant therapies.2  Understanding the molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma is urgently needed for the  development of effective therapeutic strategy.3 MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of noncoding RNAs 18–25 nucleotides in length  and generally lead to messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or inhibition of transla - tion via directly binding to 3 ′-untranslated regions (3 ′-UTRs) of mRNA of their target  genes.4 Through negatively mediating their target genes, miRs are involved in a variety  of biological processes, such as cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation,  migration, and tumorigenesis.5 Moreover, various miRs have been found to be asso - ciated with the development and progression of osteosarcoma and thus may become  potential therapeutic targets or candidates.3correspondence: Wenfeng Xiao Department of Orthopedics,  Xiangya hospital central south  University, 87 Xiangya road, changsha,  hunan 410008, People’s republic  of china Tel/fax +86 731 8975 3006 email boneswenfeng@163.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Li et al Running head recto: Role of miR-200b in osteosarcoma DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S96561",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/43/d6/ott-9-3101.PMC4888717.pdf

"DME is the leading cause of vision loss in people with diabetes and affects  6.8%–7.5% of patients with diabetes worldwide.1 Globally, 26.7 million people are  living with DME, 4 million of whom are in Europe, and many are of working age.1–3  In the future, DME is set to increase as a public health problem due to aging popula - tions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East and the increased prevalence of diabetes,  longer duration of diabetes, and older age at onset.3,4 RVO is also an important and  growing cause of vision loss, and after diabetic retinopathy, it is the most common  cause of reduced vision due to retinal vascular disease.5–8 Prevalence estimates indicate  that RVO affects 18.1 million people .30 years of age worldwide, with ~2.5 million Correspondence: sobha sivaprasad NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research  Centre, 162 City road, london eC1V  2PD, UK Tel +44 20 7566 2039 Fax +44 20 7299 3738 email senswathi@aol.co m Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Sivaprasad and Oyetunde Running head recto: Impact of injection therapy on retinal patients DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S100168",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/cf/19/opth-10-939.PMC4888735.pdf

"Although excision of frag - ments or radial head fails to significantly alter elbow biomechanics in an otherwise  intact elbow, radial head resection possibly results in valgus instability, degenerative  changes, or early osteoarthritis of the ulnohumeral joint.4 Preservation of the radial  head via ORIF is currently recommended in order to restore alignment and stability  of the elbow.5 The use of 2.7 mm interfragmentary screws is an ideal treatment option  (superior bending stiffness), but it may fail to reach the requirements of rigid fixation.6  As for RHR, it may cause more severe joint damage, subsequent joint degeneration, or  reoperation.4 In addition, ORIF with a Kirschner wire, with advantages of low profile  and requiring less exposure, does not provide rigid internal fixation; the Kirschner wire  was left protruding through the skin, which led to osteomyelitis and avascular necrosis  of the radial head.7 Businger et al8 evaluated the value of an “on-table” reconstruction  technique in isolated comminuted radial head fractures without ulnar instability and Correspondence: Jun Hu Department of orthopedics, The First  Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen  University, 2nd Zhongshan Road, No 58,  Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong  510080, people’s Republic of China email hjhujun66@aliyun.co m Journal name: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Article Designation: Case report Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Yu et al Running head recto: Rare case in the right radius of a 20-year-old man DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S107640",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/0f/2f/tcrm-12-825.PMC4888862.pdf

"In fact, it is  a cell death mechanism that occurs in a programmed manner.1 Apoptosis has attracted  increasing attention in recent years due to its possible role in diseases associated with  the central nervous system, specifically neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.2 As  neurodegeneration is a widely accepted mechanism of schizophrenia, the apoptotic  mechanisms have been investigated in schizophrenia patients in both clinical and  experimental studies.3 Currently, the general understanding is that the increased apoptosis levels in patients  with schizophrenia and the subsequent neuronal, dendritic, and synaptic losses are  due to an increased or imbalanced apoptotic mechanism.3 Other mechanisms, such  as oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and reduced neurotrophic support, are  also either directly or indirectly associated with apoptosis.4 Furthermore, the reduced  incidence of cancer and the reduced exposure to general cancer risks in patients  with schizophrenia might support the notion of increased apoptotic mechanisms  occurring in these patients.5,6 Based on such findings, researchers have suggested correspondence: Yakup albayrak Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of  Medicine, Namik Kemal Universitesi  Uygulama ve Arastırma Hastanesi  Psikiyatri Poliklinigi Tunca cad 100  Yil mah, Tekirdag 59100, Turkey Tel +90 282 505 635 5434 email dr.fuge@hotmail.co m Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Beyazyüz et al Running head recto: Increased serum levels of apoptosis in DS patients DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S106993",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/50/e0/ndt-12-1261.PMC4889085.pdf

"Keywords:  nocturnal eating syndrome, night eating, eating disorder, hypnotics, amnesia,  sleepwalking, benzodiazepine Introduction Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is a behavioral disorder in which recurrent  episodes of dysfunctional eating after arousal, usually within 2–3  hours of sleep onset,  occur almost nightly.1–3 Typical SRED frequently features partial loss of conscious - ness during eating episodes, with subsequent impaired recall.1 The prevalence rate of  SRED in the general population has been reported to be 1%–4.6%.4,5 Several reports  have shown that SRED often occurs in persons with previous or current episodes of  sleepwalking, and the two disorders share some common clinical features.6 Both SRED  and sleepwalking showed a similar timing of episode particularly during the first half  of the night, numerous arousals from stage N3 sleep.6 Based on this information,  SRED has been considered to occur as a result of a dysfunction in sustaining stable  slow-wave sleep, which is similar to sleepwalking.7 Night eating syndrome (NES) is another important condition in the disordered  nighttime eating spectrum, showing episodes of hyperphagia with full consciousness  just before or during the nocturnal sleep period.8 Although SRED and NES have been  accepted as distinct disease categories, many of their features overlap.9 On the other correspondence: Yoko Komada Department of somnology, Tokyo  Medical University, 6-1-1 shishinjuku,  shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8402, Japan Tel +81 3 3351 6141 Fax +81 3 3351 6208 email ykoma@tokyo-med.ac.j p Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Komada et al Running head recto: Clinical features of primary and drug-induced sleep-related eating disorder DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S107462",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/da/68/ndt-12-1275.PMC4889092.pdf
