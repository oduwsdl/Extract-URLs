"Kim et al • Silver ion releasing elastomers www.e-kjo.org 88 http://dx.doi.org/10.4041/kjod.2012.42.2.87 INTRODUCTION   Placement of fixed orthodontic appliances leads to  in creased plaque accumulation and proliferation of  cario  genic pathogens such as Streptococcus mutans  (S.  mutans ).1,2 These changes may be responsible for decal­ cification or white spot lesions that lead to incipient caries  during orthodontic treatment.3      Various orthodontic materials that contain or release  fluo ride and that were designed to have an antimicrobial  effect on cariogenic pathogens have been used as pre­ ventive measures against demineralization and white spot  lesions.4 However, the timing and amount of fluoride  released by these devices in the oral environment are  questionable.5   While elastomeric ligatures are frequently used in ortho­ dontic treatment, they are associated with more bacteria  in the plaque than when steel ligatures are used.6 In  spite of the introduction of fluoridated elastomers in an  effort to overcome these shortcomings, an in vivo  study  failed to demonstrate the antimicrobial activities of these  elastomers.7   A product that releases silver ions from silver ­zeolite  that is incorporated into an elastomer (Orthoshield Safe  T­tie; Ortho Organizers,  CA, USA) has been introduced  in order to reduce bacterial development around ortho­ dontic appliances.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/98/4f/kjod-42-87.PMC3481969.pdf
