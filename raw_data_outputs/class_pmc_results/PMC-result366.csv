"Keywords:  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute exacerbation, wheezing phenotype Introduction COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its burden is both  substantial and increasing.1 Previous studies have shown heterogeneity of clinical  phenotypes in patients with COPD, which may correlate with treatment response and  disease progression.2–5 Identification of these phenotypes can help determine treatment  choices to achieve better disease control.6,7 Wheezing is a feature of small airway narrowing that frequently occurs in patients  with asthma; some clinicians used wheezing as a diagnostic criterion for asthma and  asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) if the patients had fixed airway obstruction.8  Previous studies showed that patients with ACOS are more likely to have wheezing  and a higher risk of exacerbations.9–12 Notably, acute exacerbation (AE) is positively Correspondence: Ming-shian lin Department of Internal Medicine, Ditmanson  Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian hospital,  No 539, Zhongxiao Road, East District, Chiayi  60002, Taiwan, republic of China Tel +886 5 276 5041 Fax +886 5 277 4511 email 02456@cych.org.t w Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Huang et al Running head recto: Wheezing in patients with COPD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S92062",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/39/13/copd-10-2121.PMC4603716.pdf

"Keywords:  glycosphingolipids, NKT cells, tumors, chemotherapy Introduction Anticancer chemotherapy has been associated with extensive toxic manifestations in  treated patients, and the potential for chemotherapy to deplete the immune system  and interfere with immunosurveillance has been a major concern.1–3 The emergence  of drug-resistant cancers is posing serious challenges for the treatment of malignant  diseases.4–6 Various immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes,  play a protective role in suppressing the development and progression of tumors.7,8 NK  T (NKT) cells, a subset of T cells, act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune  responses, because they secrete enormous amounts of cytokines upon activation with  specific lipid ligands.9 We have previously shown that type I NKT cells have an antitumor  immune response, and their adoptive transfer reduces the incidence of B-cell lymphoma  in type I NKT cell-deficient mice.10 Invariant NKT (iNKT) cell-deficient mice showed  susceptibility to methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas and B16F10 melanoma tumors.11  Moreover, the liver-derived iNKT cells were able to reverse the methylcholanthrene- induced effects during the early stages of sarcomas.12 The activation of NKT-cell func - tion using specific ligands holds a therapeutic role in the treatment of various diseases, correspondence: Masood a Khan college of applied Medical sciences,  Qassim University, Buraydah 51452,  saudi arabia Tel +966 50 705 9437 Fax +966 16 380 1628 email a_khan@qu.edu.s a Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Khan et al Running head recto: Glycosphingosomes increase antitumor activity of Lip-Dox DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S86467",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/87/d7/ijn-10-6331.PMC4605236.pdf

"Keywords:  silica nanoparticles, sodium-22, radiotracer, biodistribution, noninvasive PET  imaging, biocompatibility, nanomedicine Introduction Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-performance molecular imaging  technique widely used for clinical and pre-clinical investigations of several diseases  due to its excellent sensitivity and limitless depth of penetration.1 PET has demon - strated significant potential utilities in oncology, neurology, and cardiology clinical  applications.2 The potentiality of this nuclear imaging modality is due to the high  sensitivity of the radiotracers, which are labeled by radioactive isotopes, such as radio - active halogens (F-18; Br-76, 77; I-124), carbon-11, and radioactive metals (Ga-68,  Cu-64).3 Micro- or even picomoles of radiolabeled materials are usually sufficient for  PET-image generation and thus the radiotracers will occupy only a minor part of the  radio-pharmaceutics and have no pharmacologically relevant activity.4correspondence: achraf al Faraj Molecular and cellular Imaging lab,  Department of radiological sciences,  college of applied Medical sciences,  King saud University, riyadh 11433,  saudi arabia Tel +966 11 469 6017 Fax +966 11 469 3565 email aalfaraj@ksu.edu.s a Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Al Faraj et al Running head recto: Sodium-22-radiolabeled silica nanoparticles for biomedical applications DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S93523",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/05/c9/ijn-10-6293.PMC4605247.pdf
