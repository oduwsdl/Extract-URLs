"In some developed regions, breast cancer is still the second-commonest  major cause of cancer death.1,2 Currently chemotherapy remains the irreplaceable  method in treating breast cancer in clinic, yet it has limited efficacy and can produce  some serious side effects for patients.3–6 On the other hand, seeking natural compounds  in treating breast cancer has become a promising research area and attracted a lot  of scholars, due to some compounds’ high efficacy and minor side effects, such as  curcumin, ( -)-epigallocatechin gallate, and emodin.7 In very recent years, we have  found a flavonoid, isoliquiritigenin (ISL; structure in Figure 1A), that is not only  able to inhibit angiogenesis of breast cancer cells via the VEGF–VEGFR2 pathway8  and prevent mammary carcinogenesis through WIF1 demethylation,9 but can also  chemosensitize breast cancer stem cells,10 serving as an autophagy inducer regulating  chemoresistance-associated autophagy.11 In addition, studies have shown that ISL can  treat breast cancer via NF κB signaling and the PI3K–Akt pathway, inhibiting p38  expression and downregulating AA-metabolizing enzymes.12–14 This evidence has  demonstrated that ISL can be a promising anti-breast cancer agent worthy of being Correspondence: Jianping Chen School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing  Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong  Kong, 10 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam,  Hong Kong 999077 Tel +852 9514 7068 Fax +852 2872 5476 email abchen@hku.h k Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Gao et al Running head recto: ISL-loaded iRGD NPs in breast cancer DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S134148",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/d6/e8/ijn-12-4147.PMC5459978.pdf

"Keywords:  secondary hyperparathyroidism, CKD-MBD, calcimimetic, dialysis Pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism  in chronic kidney disease Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a key regulator of calcium metabolism; it stimulates bone  reabsorption, increases serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and promotes vitamin D  synthesis.1 Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a common, serious, and progres - sive complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is characterized by high serum  PTH, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and disturbances in mineral metabolism, mainly  hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.1 These mineral disturbances mainly cause renal  osteodystrophy, progressive vascular calcification, and in turn, cardiovascular disease  and death, especially in patients receiving hemodialysis.2–5 Together, this constella - tion of comorbidities is known as CKD–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).6 Correspondence: Mario Cozzolino Department of Health Sciences, Renal  Division, University of Milan, School  of Medicine, San Paolo Hospital, via di  Rudinì, 8 - 20142, Milan, italy Tel +39 02 8184 4381 email mario.cozzolino@unimi.i t Journal name: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2017 Volume: 13 Running head verso: Cozzolino et al Running head recto: Emerging treatment for CKD-MBD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S108490",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/58/f2/tcrm-13-679.PMC5461056.pdf
