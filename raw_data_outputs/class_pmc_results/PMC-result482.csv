"Since the concentration  of  Hb  S  is  a  pathophysiological  factor of  disease  severity,  the  presence  of  lower  concentrations  of Hb S  due  to  double  heterozygosity  can  determine  phenotypic heterogeneity.1,3However,  other  genetic  and  environmental factors can  also  have  an  effect  on  the  disease  phenotype.4 Studies looking for  abnormal  hemoglobins  (Hbs)  in  the Brazilian  population  have  been  performed  since  the  1950s.5–8 However, the  Brazilian  Government  Directive  MS  #  822/01 that  regulates  newborn  screening  for  hemoglobinopathies, has promoted an increase  of  data  about  hemoglobinopathies in different  Brazilian  regions.9–11This  associated  with  the  use of  isoelectric  focusing  electrophoresis  (IEF)  and  high-pressure liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  as  diagnostic  methods,  has enabled the  identiﬁcation  of  an  increasing  number  of  abnor- mal  Hbs  as  well  as  compound  heterozygous  states  of  Hb  S.12–14 An example is  a  paper  published  in  this  issue  of  the  Revista Brasileira  de  Hematologia  e  Hemoterapia  that  shows  data  on a cohort  of  children  with  hemoglobin  SD  pattern.15 Hb  D  is  an  abnormal  Hb,  which  migrates  to  the  same position as  Hb  S  in  electrophoresis  at  alkaline  pH,  and  can be  separated  from  Hb  S  in  acid  pH.16–18Several  Hb  D  have been described in different  racial  groups,  but  the  majority presented  a  point  mutation  in  codon  121  of  the  /H9252-globin gene,  which  results  in  the  substitution  of  glutamic  acid  for DOI of original article:  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjhh.2016.05.002 .",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/5a/73/main.PMC4997905.pdf

"Those intersection GO terms were  analyzed using REVIGO.52 Evaluation of intrinsic disorder propensity and disorder‑based  functionality For prostate cancer‑related proteins from the KEGG dataset, we  analyzed the per‑residue disorder propensities by PONDR‑FIT,  PONDR® VLXT, PONDR® VSL2 algorithms,42–46 and by the PONDR®  VL3 predictor that possesses high accuracy in finding long IDPRs.53  We also used a consensus approach MobiDB,54,55 applied a binary  disorder classifier charge‑hydropathy plot  (CH‑plot) that evaluates  the predisposition of a given protein to be ordered or disordered as a  whole,18,56 predicted potential disorder‑based binding sites using the  ANCHOR algorithm,57,58 looked at the functional disorder using D2P2  database,59 and analyzed interactivity of these proteins by STRING.60 The MobiDB database (http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/),54,55 that  generates consensus disorder scores by aggregating the output  from ten predictors, such as two versions of IUPred (IUPred‑long  and IUPred‑short),61 three versions of ESpritz (ESpritz‑DisProt,  ESpritz‑NMR, and ESpritz‑XRay),62 two versions of DisEMBL  (DisEMBL‑465 and DisEMBL‑HL),63 JRONN,64 PONDR® VSL2B,46,65  and GlobPlot.66 A CH‑plot represents an input protein as a point within the 2D  graph where the mean Kate‑Doolittle hydrophobicity and the mean  absolute net charge are used as the X‑ and Y‑coordinates, respectively.",OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/07/8b/AJA-18-662.PMC5000786.pdf
"The optimal boundary that provided the most accurate  order‑disorder classification was shown to represent seven points  located in the 12th through 18th bins.56 Thus, in the CDF analysis,  order‑disorder classification is based on whether a CDF curve of a given protein is above (ordered) or below (disordered) a majority of  boundary points.56 Disorder evaluations together with important disorder‑related  functional information were retrieved from the D2P2 database  (http://d2p2.pro/),59 which is a database of predicted disorder for a  large library of proteins from completely sequenced genomes.59 D2P2  database uses outputs of IUPred,61 PONDR® VLXT,42 PrDOS,67 PONDR®  VSL2B,46,65 PV2,59 and ESpritz.62 The database is further supplemented  by data concerning location of various curated posttranslational  modifications and predicted disorder‑based protein‑binding sites.",OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/07/8b/AJA-18-662.PMC5000786.pdf
"Finally, potential disorder‑based protein‑binding sites of prostate  cancer‑related proteins from the KEGG dataset were identified by the  ANCHOR algorithm.57,58 This algorithm utilizes the pair‑wise energy  estimation approach originally used by IUPred.61,68 This approach  acts on the hypothesis that long regions of disorder include localized  potential‑binding sites which are not capable of folding on their own  due to not being able to form enough favorable intrachain interactions,  but can obtain the energy to stabilize via interaction with a globular  protein partner.57,58 Evaluation of interactability of prostate cancer‑related proteins in  the KEGG dataset Interactability of human proteins related to prostate cancer from  the KEGG dataset was further evaluated by the APID (Agile Protein  Interactomes DataServer) web server (http://apid.dep.usal.es).69  APID has information on 90 379 distinct proteins from more than  400 organisms (including Homo sapiens ) and on the 678 441 singular  protein‑protein interactions.",OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/07/8b/AJA-18-662.PMC5000786.pdf
"To understand  how common this phenomenon is, we used the ability of the APID  web server (http://apid.dep.usal.es) to build a specific PPI network  between proteins included in a query list.69 Figure  5 represents the  results of application of this tool to prostate cancer‑related proteins  from the KEGG dataset and shows that all proteins with known  interactions are involved in the formation of a common interactive  cluster, where each prostate cancer‑related protein interacts with at  least one other prostate cancer‑related protein.",OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/07/8b/AJA-18-662.PMC5000786.pdf
