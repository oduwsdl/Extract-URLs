"Insulin signaling  involves synaptogenesis and synaptic remodeling.3 Insulin is directly involved in neurotransmitter expression (eg, acetylcholine or  norepinephrine), which explains its involvement in cognitive functioning.4,5 Further,  insulin modulates glucose metabolism in other organs and increases cerebral glucose  metabolism, which may be a potential mechanism for its involvement in cognition.6 Alcohol use disorder results in substantial damage to the central nervous system  in many patients.7 Long-term alcohol use contributes to several somatic symptoms,  including hepatic dysfunction or endocrine disorders,8 and excessive alcohol intake  contributes to acute or chronic pancreatitis.correspondence: Dai-Jin Kim Department of Psychiatry, seoul  st Mary’s hospital, college of Medicine,  The catholic University of Korea,  222 Banpo-daero, seocho-gu,   seoul 137-701, republic of Korea Tel +82 2 2258 6086 Fax +82 2 594 3870 email kdj922@catholic.ac.k r Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Han et al Running head recto: Candidate biomarker to indicate cognitive functioning in alcohol dependence DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S92029",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ac/5a/ndt-11-2903.PMC4654541.pdf

"Keywords:  binding free energy, loop docking, molecular dynamics, HIV -1 protease inhibitors,  anticancer Introduction Cancer, a heterogeneous disease, is one of the major causes of death worldwide.1  In 2008, GLOBOCAN estimated the occurrence of ∼12.7 million cancer cases and  7.6 million cancer deaths ( ∼21,000 cancer deaths a day); of these, 56% (2.8  million)  of the cases and 64% (4.8  million) of the deaths occurred in the economically  developing countries.1 According to the American Cancer Society, it has been  reported that there remains an expected increase in the cancer incidences in the  next 20 years, more especially in African regions.2,3correspondence: Mahmoud es soliman Molecular Modelling and Drug Design  lab, school of health sciences, Westville  campus, University of KwaZulu-natal,  University road, Westville 3600,  south africa Tel +27 31 260 7413 Fax +27 31 26 0779 email soliman@ukzn.ac.z a Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Arodola and Soliman Running head recto: HIV PR inhibitors as potential anticancer agents DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S87653",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/14/7c/dddt-9-6055.PMC4654555.pdf

"Keywords:  osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, risk of cardiovascular event, drug therapy,  drug safety Introduction Strontium ranelate is a relatively new drug used for the treatment of osteoporosis that  both stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption.1,2 Randomized, placebo- controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of strontium ranelate in reducing  the risk of osteoporotic vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.1–3 Strontium ranelate was  first approved for use in the European Union in 2004.4 Guidelines from the UK’s National  Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence describe strontium ranelate as an alternative  treatment option for the prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal  women who are unable to comply with the special instructions for the administration  of bisphosphonates, namely alendronate and either risedronate or etidronate.5 The safety profile of strontium ranelate was similar to that of placebo in individual  clinical trials, but in recent pooled analyses conducted by the European Medicines correspondence: ankita Modi center for Observational and real- World evidence (cOre), Merck & co.,  Inc., supporting Bone Products, Mailstop  crB-205, Kenilworth, nJ, Usa Tel +1 908 236 4563 email ankita.modi@merck.co m Journal name: International Journal of Women’s Health Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 7 Running head verso: Yu et al Running head recto: Cardiovascular events and risk factors in strontium users DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S88627",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/29/06/ijwh-7-913.PMC4655964.pdf

"The course of BD has traditionally  been viewed as episodic, that is with symptomatic and functional recovery between mood  episodes.1 This view has recently been challenged by evidence documenting how, despite  symptomatic improvements or recovery following mood episodes, many individuals with  BD experience difficulties in daily functioning (eg, there are higher rates of unemployment  and disability among individuals with BD than in the normal population).2–7 Cognitive and functional impairments have been observed in patients with BD  even during the euthymic phase of the disease, potentially representing trait-associated  rather than state-associated characteristics of the disorder.2–7 From a neurophysiologi - cal point of view, event-related potentials (ERPs) allow the identification of specific  neurocognitive deficiencies.8–10 In particular, the P300 component has been studied  widely, and it is believed to be related to stimuli categorization as an indicator of selec - tive attention and memory updating.8 The P300 consists of two main subcomponents,  namely P3a and P3b.8,10 The P3a is elicited by a distracter stimulus, and it has been correspondence: amedeo Minichino Department of Neurology and Psychiatry,   sapienza University of rome, Viale  dell’Università 30, rome, italy email amedeomin@gmail.co mJournal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Bersani et al Running head recto: Prefrontocerebellar tDCS and cognition DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S91625",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/22/1b/ndt-11-2913.PMC4657792.pdf

"Keywords:  endocan, restless legs syndrome, RLS, atherosclerosis, endothelial Introduction Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensory–motor disorder characterized by intense,  unpleasant, disagreeable sensations (paresthesia and dysesthesia) in the extremities  (mostly in legs), which begin or worsen in the evening or at night during the periods of  rest and which are relieved by movement.1 It affects approximately 5%–15% of the gen - eral population,1 and the diagnosis is based on clinical features.1 Proposed pathogenetic  mechanisms for RLS symptoms include the dopaminergic dysfunction, occurring either  primarily or triggered by iron deficiency on the background of genetic predisposition.2,3  Also, RLS has been reported to be associated with a number of conditions, including  diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.4,5 With regard to the  cardiovascular risk, while some authors have reported an increased cardiovascular  risk in RLS patients,5–10 others have found no such association.11–14 Furthermore, RLS  has even been proposed to confer protective effects against atherosclerosis.15,16 Recent  studies have shown that vascular endothelium plays a fundamental role in processes  such as inflammation, coagulation, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion, through the correspondence: Mehmet a cikrikcioglu Department of internal Medicine, Medical  Faculty, Bezmialem Vakif University,  34093 Fatih, istanbul, Turkey Tel +90 212 453 1700 Fax +90 212 621 7580 email malicikrikcioglu@yahoo.co m Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Celik et al Running head recto: Endocan and RLS DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S92771",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/3d/61/ndt-11-2919.PMC4657799.pdf
