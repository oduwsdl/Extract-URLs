"For  example, many studies have indicated that nanotubular and nanotextured titania (cre - ated through various anodization conditions) could modulate the functions of many  types of cells and might be used as an excellent bioactive interface for implantable  devices.6–8 Specifically, it has been reported that fine-tuning the dimensions of such  titania nanofeatures in the 10–200 nm range can enhance functions of osteoblasts,  chondrocytes, and endothelial cells.9,10 Anodization of titanium to form titania nano - tubular structures has also been shown to inhibit bacteria growth and macrophage  (ie, inflammatory cell) functions; again, all without the use of pharmaceutical agents,  which may have harmful side effects.9 Similar to titania nanotube arrays, porous anodic alumina (PAA) is a self-organized  material with nanopore arrays that has a relatively long-range order of nanoporous  structures.11 In addition, the PAA porous structure can be uniquely altered by  varying Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Journal Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2014 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Ni et al Running head recto: Understanding improved osteoblast behavior DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S60346",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b4/4a/ijn-9-3325.PMC4099197.pdf

"Adefovir in decompensated cirrhosis http://www.e-cmh.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2014.20.2.168INTRODUCTION  About 350 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis B  virus (HBV) infection,1 and these individuals are at increased risk  of developing hepatic complications, such as cirrhosis, hepatic de - compensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).2 The ultimate  goals of HBV treatment are to induce remission and to prevent  such complications by sustained suppression of HBV replication.3  Interferons, including pegylated interferons, and nucleotide ana - logues are regarded as standard treatment for patients with  chronic hepatitis B, and nucleotide analogues have been shown  effective and safe in chronically infected patients with decompen - sated cirrhosis.3-11 Treatment with the nucleotide analogue lamivu - dine has been shown to improve liver function (Child-Pugh class)  and to prolong survival in patients with decompensation.4,5,7-9,11 In  addition, earlier administration of antiviral drugs (that is, to pa - tients with Child-Pugh B) leads to better prognosis than later ad - ministration to patients with poor liver function (that is, Child- Pugh C).11 Over time, however, most patients experience resistance to  long-term lamivudine therapy.12,13 Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is an - other orally bioavailable nucleotide analogue, effective against  wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV in vitro and in the clin - ic.14-19 Now, the outcome of ADV rescue therapy in chronic hepati - tis patients with lamivudine resistance can be seen in practice  guideline for hepatitis B through many clinical studies.3,20 In addi - tion, short-term treatment with 10 mg/day ADV of patients with  decompensated cirrhosis and lamivudine resistance have been as - sociated with favorable virologic and biochemical responses.17-19  Less is known, however, about the long-term outcomes associated  with ADV rescue therapy in decompensated patients with lamivu - dine-resistant HBV.19 We have therefore assessed long-term clini - cal outcomes after ADV rescue therapy in decompensated patients  infected with lamivudine-resistant HBV.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/be/d8/cmh-20-168.PMC4099332.pdf
