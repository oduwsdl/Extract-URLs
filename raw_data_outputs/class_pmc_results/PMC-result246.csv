"Keywords:  cognition, elderly, mortality, community-dwelling, MMSE Introduction A systematic review of the literature regarding community-dwelling individuals  aged 65 and over showed that the levels of cognitive impairment among these indi - viduals were associated with an increased risk of mortality, and this association was  found even for mild levels of impairment.1 A review focusing on the association of  mild cognitive impairment with mortality, which included studies on population-based  samples with persons aged 65 and over, found that the relative risk for participants  with mild cognitive impairment varied from 1.0 to 1.9.2 Another review article  focusing on the association between geriatric syndrome and survival found that  elderly persons aged 65 to 74 with advanced dementia have a higher risk of mortality  than elderly persons without dementia, but the difference between people with and  without dementia in remaining life expectancy may be 1 year or less in the “old-old”,  particularly 90 and over.3 In a large multicenter study of a population aged 65 years and over, an associa - tion between cognition and survival was relatively uniform across three age groups  (74 years, 75–84 years, and 85 + years), but no association was found in men Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Journal Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2014 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Takata et al Running head recto: Cognition and mortality in the elderly DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S64107",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ee/58/cia-9-1691.PMC4199981.pdf
