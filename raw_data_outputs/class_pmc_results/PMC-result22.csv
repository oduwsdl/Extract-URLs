"Data privacy, for example, is a hot topic in genomic epidemiology, 22,23as well as being a concern for government, industry,24,25the media and even the general public.26Biomedical science has responded cautiously to these concerns, ensuring that all ethico-legal stipulations are met and that new issuesare dealt with carefully, as and when they arise.23,27Given this caution, it is perhaps surprising that there has been such striking recent progress in detecting genetic associations with complex diseases:3,28‘in the past three years genome-wide association studies (GWAS) .... have reproducibly identified hundreds of associations of common genetic variants with over 80 diseases and traits (http://www.genome.gov/ gwastudies)’.9But, in one sense, genomic epidemi- ology has been fortunate.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/19/a0/dyq111.PMC2972441.pdf
