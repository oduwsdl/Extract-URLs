"Karyotypes of tumors frequently range from 40 to 60 chromo - somes (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman), and it  has been proposed that this level of aneuploidy is generated  through an elevated rate of single chromosome missegregation  as seen in chromosomal instability (CIN; Lengauer et al., 1998).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/30/72/JCB_200905057.PMC2819684.pdf
"These data fit with  the concordance of aneuploidy and disruption of the p53  pathway in many tumors, but the presence of aneuploid  cells in some normal human and mouse tissues indicates  that there are known exceptions to the involvement of p53  in aneuploid cells and that tissue context may be impor - tant in how cells respond to aneuploidy.Proliferation of aneuploid human cells is limited by  a p53-dependent mechanism Sarah L.
