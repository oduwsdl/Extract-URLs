"Keywords:  P-selectin, antitumor, antithrombosis, anti-inflammation, nanomedicine Introduction Cancer induces an increased risk of coagulation and ~5%–10% of patients with cancer  may develop thrombosis within the first year after diagnosis;1 and in addition, coagula - tion promotes cancer growth.2 Chronic inflammation is involved in all stages of cancer  development, and inflammatory tumor microenvironment is a hallmark of cancer.3,4  According to the epidemiological and clinical estimation, ~25% of cancers are linked  to chronic and acute inflammations.5–7 It has been well documented that P-selectin  triggers the adhesion of leukocytes toward platelets, cancer cells, endothelial cells and  other leukocytes at the thrombosis sites, inflammation tissues and tumor tissues.8–12 In  addition, inhibiting P-selectin-mediated interactions of tumor cells with blood constitu - ents results in attenuation of tumor metastasis.11,13–16 Elevated serum level of P-selectin  has been correlated with some human neoplastic disorders, such as lung  cancer, breast  cancer, melanoma malignancy and hematological malignancy.17–21 Clinical trials  show that P-selectin inhibitors, such as heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin,  can protect cancer patients in advanced stage from the complication of thrombosis, correspondence: Ming Zhao; shiqi Peng college of Pharmaceutical sciences,  capital Medical University, number 10  You an Men Wai Xi Tou Tiao, Fengtai  District, Beijing 100069,   People’s republic of china Tel +86 10 8391 1535;   +86 10 8391 1528 email mingzhao@bjmu.edu.c n;   sqpeng@bjmu.edu.c n Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Wu et al Running head recto: HMCEF: development toward nanoscaled antitumor drug DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S123919",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/7e/e2/dddt-11-225.PMC5265142.pdf

"Keywords:  multimorbidity, comorbidity, patient preference, patient decision-making,  medicines, geriatrics Introduction Multimorbidity is common in the older population, and over 60% of those aged 65 years  and older will have 2 or more chronic conditions.1 Multimorbidity is associated with  polypharmacy, high prevalence of treatment conflicts and potentially as a consequence,  increased risk of medicine-related adverse events.2 Treatment conflicts arise when the  treatment of one condition results in the worsening of another condition present in a  patient, as a result of medicine–medicine or medicine–disease interactions.3–5 Further,  the majority of current clinical guidelines fail to provide specific recommendations  for treatment in the setting of multimorbidity.6,7 This can lead to complex and difficult  management decisions for both the patients and the clinicians caring for them.8,9Correspondence: Gillian E Caughey Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy  research centre, sansom institute for  Health Research, School of Pharmacy  and Medical Sciences, University of  south Australia, gPO Box 2471, Adelaide,  sA 5001, Australia Tel +61 8 8302 1749 email gillian.caughey@unisa.edu.a u Journal name: Patient Preference and Adherence Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Caughey et al Running head recto: Treatment preferences in older patients with multimorbidity DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S118836",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/f9/20/ppa-11-131.PMC5268332.pdf

"59,78A3R stimulation inhibits proliferation of PC3 prostate carcinoma, HCT-116 colon carcinoma and MIA- PaCa pancreatic carcinoma, but on the other hand promotes proliferation of HT29 and CaCo2 colon cancer cells.59The A3R couples with the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 βWNT/ β- catenin pathway; therefore, it was suggested to inhibit prolifera- tion via this pathway.79Contrasting data are reported on theeffect of A3R stimulation on metastatic spreading.80,81Despite these con ﬂicting results, the A3R is the adenosine receptor most widely distributed and more amenable for pharmacological targeting in cancer cells.82,83A phase I/II clinical trial to test the efﬁcacy of A3R agonists for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has been completed, retrieving encouraging results84 and two more are about to start (https://clinicaltrials.gov/).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/25/51/onc2016206a.PMC5269532.pdf
