"In support of this idea as it  applies to medical education, the authors of the previously  mentioned AAMC-HHMI report felt that increasing the  accessibility of undergraduates to “real science” represented  an outstanding way to produce a generation of medical  professionals best prepared to utilize the emerging tools of  genomic medicine.18 In this spirit, several initiatives have developed in recent  years that take a crowdsourcing approach to engage prepro - fessional students in the authentic research work that will  best prepare them for future medical careers.21 For instance,  HHMI has supported the development of the Science Edu - cation Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and  Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program in which undergraduates isolate bacteriophages from the environment  and perform molecular and bioinformatics characterizations  of their discoveries over a two-semester introductory biology  course ( http://seaphages.or g).22 Other institutions have worked  with their academic libraries to develop course-based experi - ences for their preclinical students that engage them with the  online databases that are becoming essential to access the full  range of available medical knowledge.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/27/75/amep-6-597.PMC4629947.pdf
"Given the need for enhanced training in  bioinformatics and online medical genetics resources among  future medical professionals, it is encouraging to note that  case-based modules in bioinformatics are being introduced in  both preclinical and clinical training programs.30 For instance,  cancer biology case studies provide an excellent venue for  teaching students about critical concepts like the acquisition  of somatic mutations during the cell cycle and how these  mutations contribute to cancer progression.8,31 Organizations  like the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science  (http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs /) and MedEdPortal (https://www.mededportal.org /) have established themselves  as clearinghouses for case studies that can be used to provide  an engaging and evidence-based way to teach genetics to  future medical professionals.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/27/75/amep-6-597.PMC4629947.pdf

"However, this education must also consider the many social  and ethical issues introduced by new technologies, including  patient privacy, the cost-effective use of health care resources,  and patient autonomy in the use of genomic screening.57–59  Teaching these ethical considerations will promote the  development of a medical workforce equipped not only with  the scientific ability to effectively utilize modern genetics Table  3 Examples of online resources for teaching genetics Tools for collecting medical history   American Medical Association   http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/ genetics-molecular-medicine/family-history.pag e My family health portrait   US Surgeon General Department of Health and Human Services   https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/FHH/html/index.htm l Genetic tests with evidence to support implementation   CDC Office of Public Health Genomics   http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/tier.ht m Pharmacogenomics knowledge base   https://www.pharmgkb.org / An online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders   Online Mendelian inheritance in Man (OMiM)   http://www.omim.org / Policy, legal, and ethical issues in genetic research   https://www.genome.gov/issues /",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/27/75/amep-6-597.PMC4629947.pdf

"Keywords:  ethnicity, falls, risks, community dwelling, older adults Introduction Falls (unplanned descents to the ground or lower level) are the most common cause of  injury and death among older adults ( $65 years old).1,2 One in three older adults fall,  25% of fallers require medical care (2.4 million in the USA in 2011, 37.3 million per  year worldwide) and 424,000 people suffer fall-related deaths yearly.3 Every 15 seconds  an older adult goes to an emergency and every 29 minutes an older adult dies due to  a fall.4 In 2011, Whites accounted for 89% of fall-related deaths (14.7/100,000) and  hospitalizations in Florida; Blacks for 4% and other non-Whites for 6%.5 Estimates for  fall-related medical costs by 2020 in the USA have been increased from 43.8 billion  in 2004 to 54.9 billion in 2011, and to 67.7 billion in 2014.6,7 Falls can also lead to fear of falling resulting in further functional decline and may  lead to nursing home placement; 40% of nursing home admissions happen after a fall.8,9  Falls are responsible for 95% of the hip fractures and 70% of the older hip fracture patients  are discharged to nursing homes.10 The good news is that some fall prevention programs  have been reported to be effective: the Tai Chi-based Moving for Better Balance program  reduced falls by 55%; the Stepping On program reduced falls by 35%; and the Matter of  Balance program resulted in $938 decrease in medical costs/year/participant.11 Fall rates are likely to differ by ethnic group, but few studies have evaluated ethnic  differences in the prevalence and risks for falls.12,13 The objective of this study was to Correspondence: edgar ramos Vieira Department of Physical Therapy, Florida  International University, 11200 sW   8th street, AhC3-430, Miami,   Fl 33199, UsA Tel +1 305 348 0568 email evieira@fiu.ed u Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Vieira et al Running head recto: Falls and ethnicity DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S91120",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/21/6a/cia-10-1705.PMC4629952.pdf

"Approaches in the  management of the third stage of labor are shifted from physiologic to active, wherein  the delivery of the placenta is hastened instead of waiting for its spontaneous delivery  to reduce blood loss.2 Active management of third stage of labor (AMTSL) involves  the injection of 10 units of oxytocin intramuscularly to the mother after the delivery  of the baby, controlled cord traction (CCT) with counter traction on the uterus, and  uterine massage.3 Recommended EINC practices for newborn care are time-bound  interventions at the time of birth, which include immediate and thorough drying of  the newborn, early skin-to-skin contact between mother and the newborn, properly  timed cord clamping and cutting, and nonseparation between mother and newborn  for early breastfeeding initiation.2correspondence: roselyn  Maghuyop-Butalid College of Nursing, Mindanao State  University-Iligan Institute of Technology,  A.

"Keywords:  silver nanoparticles, surface modification, antibacterial effects, cytotoxicity, plasma  immersion ion implantation Introduction Rough surfaces are commonly used for bone anchorage on titanium dental implants.1–3  Compared to the smooth one, roughed titanium demonstrates superior osseointegration  properties.4,5 The commercially used sand-blasted, large grit, and acid-etched (SLA)  procedure produces a rough surface with long-term stability,6–8 which is optimal to  enhance bone-to-implant contact according to the consensus paper of Lang et al.9 Unfortunately, the increased surface roughness produced by SLA treatments could  lead to greater bacterial adhesion.10,11 Once adhered, bacteria tend to aggregate in a  hydrated polymeric matrix to form a biofilm on the implant, which is difficult for host  defense and antimicrobial therapy to destroy.12 Such implant-related infections may  lead to suppuration, revision surgery, and even removal of the device, all of which are  associated with extremely high medical costs.13,14 It is well known that microorganisms  and host cells compete for the substrate in a process called “race for the surface”.15,16 correspondence: hongchang lai Department of Oral and Maxillofacial  Implantology, shanghai Ninth People’s  hospital, school of Medicine, shanghai  Jiao Tong University, 639 Zhizaoju road,  shanghai 200011, People’s republic of  china Tel +86 21 2327 1699 ext 5298 Fax +86 21 5307 3068 email lhc9@hotmail.co m  Xuanyong liu shanghai Institute of ceramics, chinese  academy of sciences, No 1295 Ding-xi  road, shanghai 200050, People’s republic  of china Tel +86 21 5241 2409 Fax +86 21 5241 2409 email xyliu@mail.sic.ac.c n Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Zhu et al Running head recto: Hierarchical micro/nanostructured titanium DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S92110",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/38/11/ijn-10-6659.PMC4629971.pdf

"Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a pattern of cellular Ca2+ responses in  nonexcitable cells, which is initialized by the binding of extracellular ligand to membrane  receptor.2,3 The activation of receptor triggers the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+  store (endoplasmic reticulum [ER]), which is followed by the ER-depletion-stimulated  Ca2+ influx via the membrane Ca2+ channels, thereby consequently achieving the rapid  increase in [Ca2+]cyto as required for the downstream signal transductions.2,3 Abnormal modulation of SOCE has been demonstrated to be responsible for various  human diseases.4 The crucial role of SOCE in the progressions of human malignancies correspondence: Yongqiang li Department of Medical Oncology,  Affiliated Cancer Hospital of  guangxi Medical University,  71 hedi road, nanning 530021,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 771 533 2578 Fax +86 771 533 2393 email gxct.ly@gmail.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 8 Running head verso: Zhang et al Running head recto: SKF95365 induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in NPC cells DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S92005",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/9e/38/ott-8-3123.PMC4629977.pdf

"Keywords:  schizophrenia, sepiapterin reductase, polymorphisms, Han Chinese population,  transcriptional activity Introduction Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder associated with a lifetime risk of  approximately 1%, characterized by various abnormalities in thought, emotion, and  behavior.1 In recent years, several mechanisms for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia  have been hypothesized, including altered homeostasis of different neurotransmitters,  such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and glutamate (Glu), in different cortical  and limbic and extrapyramidal pathways.2–4 In this regard, abnormalities in enzymatic  activities involved in the biosynthesis or release of neurotransmitters may influence the  functioning of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and lead to psychiatric  disorders including schizophrenia.5,6 Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), as a critical cofactor, is essentially required for  the enzymatic activities of phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and  tryptophan hydroxylase; the last two enzymes participate in the rate-limiting steps  of the biosynthesis of the monoamine neurotransmitter DA and 5-HT, respectively.7   Additionally, the increased release of DA, 5-HT, and Glu stimulated by an enhance - ment of intracellular BH4 has been reported repeatedly, suggesting that BH4 is a  regulator of neurotransmitter release.8,9 In recent years, a significant plasma deficit correspondence: Bin Zhao; Keshen li Institute of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital  of guangdong Medical University,  Zhanjiang, 524001, guangdong,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 759 238 6772; 86 759 238 6949 Fax +86 759 238 6772; 86 759 238 6949 email binzhaoe@163.co m;  likeshen1971@126.co m Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Fu et al Running head recto: Sepiapterin reductase gene promoter polymorphisms DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S92986",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/76/ec/ndt-11-2793.PMC4630190.pdf

"Keywords:  graphene quantum dots, drug delivery, pH-sensitive, controlled release, traceable Introduction In the past decades, nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) have shown  promising impact on cancer treatments due to the improved performance of the carried  drugs as a result of better pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profiles of the drug.1–5  This is achieved because nanoparticle-based carriers can easily be modified according  to the demand to realize, for example, spatial and temporal control of drug delivery and  release, which finally improves the drug efficiency.6,7 Furthermore, a nanoparticle’s  surface can be functionalized with targeting molecules such as arginine-glycine-aspartic  acid (RGD), folic acid, or antibodies to improve drug delivery to target tumor cells,  which additionally will reduce the side effects of drugs reaching healthy cells.1,8–10 In general, most nanoparticles are internalized via endocytosis and end up in endo/ lysosomal compartments,11,12 which are rather acidic (pH 4.5–5.5) in nature compared  with the extracellular environment (pH 7.4).13 Furthermore, some tumors are slightly  more acidic than healthy tissue or the blood.14,15 Taking advantage of such differences,  a DDS with an internal trigger (pH) can be designed to perform drug release only  inside tumor cells, which will have a great impact on the availability of the drug to  cancer cells.2,16–20 Tracking the whole process (eg, with fluorescence) is crucial not  only to biologically characterize the performance of the nanomaterial (ie, uptake, drug  release, metabolism, the fate of the carrier and of the drug, etc), but also to provide  metrics for the efficacy of the treatment response.21,22 Traditionally, semiconductor  quantum dots with excellent intrinsic tunable fluorescence properties compared with  organic fluorophores have been widely used in bioimaging.6,7 Recently, semiconductor  quantum dots have also been used as traceable DDSs.6,7,23correspondence: hong liu center of Bio and Micro/Nano Functional  Materials, state Key laboratory of  crystal Materials, shandong University,  27 south shanda road, Jinan, 250100,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 531 883 628 07 Fax +86 531 883 628 07 email hongliu@sdu.edu.c n  Pilar rivera gil Institute of chemistry, rovira i Virgili  University, carrer Marcel.li Domingo s/n,  43007 Tarragona, spain email pilar.rivera@urv.ca t Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Qiu et al Running head recto: Graphene quantum dots: pH-sensitive drug carrier DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S91864",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/e7/ec/ijn-10-6709.PMC4630193.pdf
