"Immediate memory also decreases with advancing age, and it is  characterized by a lower ability of thinking and deciding.3 The rate of memory impairment varies among different populations, which can  be explained by the possible effects of factors including average age of respondents,  type of questions asked, sex differences, educational level, and depression.1 With  the substantial increase in the incidences of dementia, early detection of possible  precursors, diagnosis, treatment, and control of modifiable risk factors are important  to reduce the rate of disease.4  Cognition is a bodily function that is decreased by ageing when there is the  impairment of memory, judgment, language, and attention.5 It can occur due to  neurodegenerative, vascular, and dysthymia/dysphoria problems.6 Impaired cognition  and reduced cognitive abilities can affect social, functional, and occupational activities.5 Correspondence: Sima Ataollahi eshkoor;  Tengku Aizan Hamid Institute of Gerontology, Universiti  Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor 43400,  Malaysia email simaataolahi@yahoo.co m;   aizan@upm.edu.m yJournal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Eshkoor et al Running head recto: MCI and elderly DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S73922",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/e4/cb/cia-10-687.PMC4401355.pdf

"Keywords:  colon cancer, VEGFA , FLT1 , KDR , angiogenesis, survival Introduction Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the progression of colon cancer, and the vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway has been shown to play a central role in  controlling tumor angiogenesis.1 VEGF ligands, such as VEGFA , VEGFB, VEGFC ,  and VEGFD  have different affinities toward, and activation potencies at, different  VEGF receptors, including VEGFR1 ( FLT1 ), VEGFR2 ( KDR ), and VEGFR3 ( FLT4 ).2  VEGFA  has been shown to activate both FLT1  and KDR ,2 and activation of this signal - ing pathway has led to vascularization and angiogenesis in malignant tissue to support  its growth and survival.3 VEGFA  has been shown to be overexpressed in colorectal  cancer specimens, especially in those tumors with secondary metastases, including  liver or lymph node metastases.4–7 Its mRNA expression in tumor as well as plasma  is higher in colorectal cancer patients than in non-diseased patients.8 Despite this,  VEGF expression has not been shown to be predictive of response to bevacizumab.9   In addition, VEGFA  was shown to be a significant predictor for morbidity in a col - orectal cancer cohort.10correspondence: Yao lin   College of Life Sciences, Qishan  Campus, Fujian Normal University,  Fuzhou, Fujian Province, People’s  Republic of China, 350108 Tel +86 0591 2286 0592 email yaolin@fjnu.edu.c n  hang Fai Kwok   Faculty of Health Sciences (E12),  University of Macau, Avenida  de Universidade, Macau, Special  Administrative Region of the People’s  Republic of China Tel +853 8822 4991 email hfkwok@umac.m o Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 8 Running head verso: Zhang et al Running head recto: VEGFA , FLT1 , and KDR  in colon cancer DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S80518",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/43/1a/ott-8-835.PMC4403689.pdf

"Keywords:  aged, elderly, strength training, amino acid, functionality Introduction Sarcopenia is one of the main causes for an increased risk of physical disability and  poor quality of life.1 The reduction in functional capacity that is derived from the  loss of muscle strength may result in increased dependency, hospitalization, and  institutionalization,2 and is a likely progression to physical frailty.3 One of the processes involved in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia seems to  be disruption in the regulation of muscle protein turnover.4 Several studies have  shown how aged muscle is less responsive to the anabolic stimuli of amino acids and  exercise,5,6 a concept now commonly referred to as anabolic resistance.7 However, some  studies have observed that this resistance can be overcome by increasing the leucine  content of meals,8 since the enhanced response in protein synthesis to greater amino  acid availability is mainly produced by leucine independently of other amino acids.9  It has been hypothesized that to maximize muscle protein synthesis in older adults,   a “leucine threshold” must be surpassed.10 This threshold would differ between young Correspondence: Joan Trabal Unitat de nutrició i Dietètica Clínica,  servei d’endocrinologia i nutrició,  hospital Clínic Universitari de Barcelona,  Villarroel, 170, 08036, Barcelona,  Catalonia, spain Tel +34 93 227 5400 ext 3424 Fax +34 93 227 5454 email joantrabal@gmail.co m Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Trabal et al Running head recto: Effects of leucine and resistance training on older adults DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S75271",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/05/1e/cia-10-713.PMC4403814.pdf
