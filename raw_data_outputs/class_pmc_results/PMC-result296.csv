"Keywords:  IOL, DSAEK, lamellar keratoplasty, endothelial corneal transplantation Introduction The surgical treatment of corneal endothelial pathology has changed significantly with  the evolution of posterior lamellar keratoplasty techniques and Descemet stripping  automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is now widely performed as the pro - cedure of choice for corneal decompensation secondary to endothelial dysfunction.1  DSAEK is associated with excellent visual outcomes, with less corneal astigmatism  and a more rapid visual recovery compared to traditional penetrating keratoplasty  (PKP).1,2 Complications of DSAEK are well-described, although the most common adverse  events do not appear to be detrimental to the ultimate visual outcome.3 Reported  complications include graft dislocation, graft rejection, primary graft failure, graft– host interface opacification, pupillary block, cystoid macular edema, and epithelial  ingrowth.2,3 It has only recently become apparent that intraocular lens (IOL) compli - cations may occur in pseudophakic patients undergoing DSAEK, with a number of  recent reports describing late IOL opacification.4–10 We report a series of six cases  of late-onset IOL opacification in pseudophakic patients after DSAEK surgery, and  review the current literature on this emerging complication.Correspondence: Peter J Morgan-Warren Department of Ophthalmology, Solihull  Hospital, Heart of England NHS  Foundation Trust, Lode Lane, Solihull,  West Midlands, B91 2JL, UK Tel +44 121 424 2000 email p.morgan-warren@doctors.org.u k Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Case Series Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Morgan-Warren et al Running head recto: IOL opacification after DSAEK DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S78930",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a0/81/opth-9-277.PMC4334325.pdf

"However, recent evi - dence shows that the receptor mediating lipolysis is neither β1 nor β2, but atypical  in nature.2 These atypical receptors, now called β3-adrenoceptors, are found on the  cell surface of both white and brown adipocytes where their stimulation promotes  both lipolysis and energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and lipolysis in  white adipose tissue (WAT).3 The thermogenesis function in BAT largely depends  on an integral membrane protein located at the inner membrane of mitochondria that  is called thermogenin or uncoupling protein one (UCP1).4,5 UCP1 is responsible for  translocation of protons into the mitochondria and elevation of respiration rate without  an increase in ATP synthesis which in turn induces energy dissipation as heat.6 It has  been reported that a chronic administration of the β3-adrenergic agonists can induce correspondence: Masoud ghorbani Pasteur institute of iran, research and  Development Department, Kilometer  25 Karaj-Tehran highway, 31599,  Tehran, iran Tel +98 26 1610 2999 Fax +98 26 1610 2900 email mghorbani@irimc.or g Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Ghorbani et al Running head recto: The effects of CL316,243 on histological changes of adipocytes DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S73891",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/3d/7a/dddt-9-669.PMC4334338.pdf
