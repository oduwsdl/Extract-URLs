RESULTS Origin of Scn8a8J The new allele of Scn8a was initially detected in neurologi- cally impaired animals from a standard three-generationENU mutagenesis screen for recessive mutations carried outin the ReproGenomics facility at Jackson Laboratory.C57BL/6J (B6) mice were mutagenized and subsequentlycrossed to strain C3HeB/FeJ (FeJ) to generate potentiallyhomozygous G 3animals (see http://reproductivegenomics.jax.org).,Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/e0/fd/ddp081.PMC2667290.pdf
