"Keywords:  acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, computed tomography,  cross-sectional area of small pulmonary vessels Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow  limitation that is not fully reversible.1–3 Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are  critical events in the natural history of the disease and are associated with accelerated loss  of lung function and poor quality of life.1,4 Pulmonary vascular disease and cardiovascular  disease often coexist with COPD and have major effects on its disease course.5 Pulmonary vascular alteration is one of the characteristic features of COPD, and  the major alteration is considered to be passive vascular compression by emphysema  and hypoxic vasoconstriction.6 COPD can cause a diminished ability to dilate small  pulmonary vessels and thickening of the vascular walls, which result in a decrease of  the lumen size and a decreased proportion of small pulmonary vessels.7,8 Pulmonary  vascular alteration is an important risk factor for exacerbations and death in COPD.9 The technological improvement of high-resolution computed tomography (CT)  has made it possible to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of small pulmonary  vessels and to evaluate small pulmonary vascular alteration in COPD patients.7,8,10  It was found that the percentage of the total CSA (%CSA) strongly correlated with Correspondence: lijun Tang; Yinsu Zhu Department of radiology, The First  Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical  University, 300 guangzhou road,  nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210029,  People’s republic of China Tel +86 147 5183 0090;   +86 136 7518 6571 Fax +86 25 8372 4440; +86 25 8372 4440 email tanglijun73@gmail.co m;  zhuyinsu1982@163.co m Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Wang et al Running head recto: Small pulmonary vascular alteration and acute exacerbations of COPD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S112651",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/f7/a6/copd-11-1965.PMC5001673.pdf

"Keywords:  everolimus, tuberous sclerosis complex, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas,  seizures, TAND Introduction Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare disease, with an annual birth  incidence estimated to be ~1 in 6,000.1 On a molecular level, TSC results from aber - rant hyperactivity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that is caused by a  mutation in one of two TSC genes, TSC1  and TSC2 , which results in an increased  cellular proliferation and tumor growth.2 TSC affects multiple major organ systems,  including the brain, skin, heart, lungs, and kidneys.3 Since the discovery of rapamycin in the 1960s,4 mTOR inhibitors, particularly  everolimus, have been used to prevent solid organ transplant rejection, augment  anticancer treatment regimens, and prevent neovascularization of artificial cardiac  stents.5 Following the identification of the genes involved in TSC in the 1990s,6  evidence in the 2000s revealed mutations or deletions that allowed mTOR activity to  go unchecked (Figure 1).7–9 Subsequent clinical trials in patients with TSC led to the  approval of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus for TSC-associated subependymal giant cell  astrocytoma (SEGA) by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 201010; it became Correspondence: David Neal Franz Department of Neurology, Cincinnati  Children’s Hospital Medical Center,  MLC 2015, 3333 Burnet Avenue,  Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA Tel +1 513 636 4222 Fax +1 513 636 1888 email d avid.franz@cchmc.or g Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Capal and Franz Running head recto: Profile of everolimus in tuberous sclerosis complex DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S91248 Point your SmartPhone at the code above.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/08/67/ndt-12-2165.PMC5003595.pdf

"Keywords:  polylactide–polyglycolide nanofibers, PLGA, collagen, 3D printing, polylactide,  PLA, bone-anchoring bolts, tendon healing Introduction Rupture of the anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament is a common knee injury  sustained by athletes in high-risk sports and victims of high-speed traffic accidents.1  Successful ligament reconstruction involves penetrating a tendon graft through the  bone tunnel and anchoring it between the femur and tibia.2 However, the healing rate  of the tendon in the bone tunnel is relatively slow due to the lack of a suitable bioint - erface between the tendon graft and bone tunnel for efficient integration.3,4 Orthopedic  basic science research strategies aiming to augment tendon–bone healing include the  use of osteoinductive growth factors, platelet-rich plasma, and enveloping the grafts  with periosteum or osteoconductive materials.5–9 In addition, numerous studies have  clinically demonstrated the promotion of tendon–bone anchoring by fixation with a  biodegradable interference screw or press-fit bone plug.10,11 In recent decades, polymeric biomaterials for clinical applications have received  increasing attention owing to their additional potential advantages.12,13 For example, correspondence: shih-Jung liu Department of Mechanical engineering,  chang gung University, 259 Wen-hwa  First road, Kwei-shan, Taoyuan 3,  Taiwan Tel +886 3 211 8166 Fax +886 3 211 8558 email shihjung@mail.cgu.edu.t w Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Chou et al Running head recto: Enhancement of tendon–bone healing DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S108939",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/81/fb/ijn-11-4173.PMC5003596.pdf
