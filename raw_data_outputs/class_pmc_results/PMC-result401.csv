"Keywords:  CLL, ofatumumab, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapy Introduction Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20, Arzerra®; GlaxoSmithKline PLC, London, UK) is a  recently approved, fully human, type I, anti-CD20 IgG1κ monoclonal antibody with a  molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa.1–6 Ofatumumab induces killing of tumor  B-cell lines and primary tumor cells via activation of complement-dependent cytotox - icity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.7,8  Compared with rituximab, which is a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody that has been in  use for more than 15 years, ofatumumab has similar ADCC but increased binding  of C1q and stronger CDC, as well as a slower off-rate and stabler CD20 binding.2,8,9  It also binds a different epitope of CD20 than rituximab.9 The more potent CDC with  ofatumumab could be the result of the greater proximity of its CD20-binding site to  the cell membrane, potentially leading to more effective deposition of complement  on the cell surface.7–10 Another anti-CD20 antibody that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obinutuzumab  (also known as GA101), a humanized, glycoengineered type 2 antibody that targets  a different CD20 epitope than ofatumumab.11 In preclinical studies, obinutuzumab  was superior to rituximab in inducing ADCC, but was less effective with respect to  CDC.12–16Correspondence: Luca Laurenti Department of Hematology, Catholic  University of the Sacred Heart, 8 Largo  Gemelli, Rome i-00168, italy Tel +39 06 3015 6016 Fax +39 06 301 7319 email l.laurenti@rm.unicatt.i t Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Laurenti et al Running head recto: Ofatumumab in CLL DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S72845",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b9/02/ott-9-421.PMC4725726.pdf
