"3 Some areas are developing faster: the  number of publications related to cell cycle-regulating protein p53 (data from PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced) increased over 100 times since the beginning of the 1980s reaching satura - tion by the next millennium.The aforementioned fast changes of rap - idly developing branches of biology, espe - cially related to practically important and well-funded biomedical aspects, may bring a load of experimental errors due to high demand for fast results, high pressure and changing human factor (which expresses at small time scales and due to increasing speed of research).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/98/7e/cib-7-e27966.PMC3990595.pdf
