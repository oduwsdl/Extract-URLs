"It is estimated that ADRs could be prevented in ~50% of cases.2–5 Of all cardiovascular drugs, most adverse effects are caused by β-blockers,  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.6,7 β-Blockers are recommended as a first-line agent for various diseases, includ - ing heart failure, hypertension, and angina, as well as after myocardial infarction.8,9  However, β-blocker therapy often produces variable responses among patients.10,11  Individual response to β-blockers in other clinical settings is substantially influenced  by genetic variation in adrenergic signaling12 and drug metabolism pathways, most  notably in the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme.13–15 CYP2D6 is one of the most important metabolic enzymes, responsible for the  biotransformation of 25% of all drugs, including most β-blockers.16,17 The observed  interindividual variation in CYP2D6 enzyme activity is mainly due to its genetic poly - morphism, which significantly affects the metabolism of ~50% of its substrate drugs.18 Correspondence: Zoran Todorović Department of Pharmacology, Clinical  Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty  of Medicine, University of Belgrade,  Dr Subotića Starijeg 1, PO Box 38,  11129 Belgrade, serbia Tel +381 11 36 43 389 Fax +381 11 36 43 397 email zoran.todorovic@mfub.bg.ac.r s Journal name: Patient Preference and Adherence Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Mugoša et al Running head recto: CYP2D6 enzyme and β-blockers DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S108579",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/3d/c6/ppa-10-1461.PMC4977081.pdf

"Keywords:  anti-hypertensive, β1- antagonist, pharmacokinetics Introduction Fast dissolving films have recently attracted increasing interest in the pharmaceutical  industry due to the improved patient compliance, accurate dosing, rapid onset of action,  pleasant taste, as well as their convenient handling and administration.1–3 These films  consist of thin oral strips formulated using hydrophilic polymers that rapidly disin - tegrate and dissolve when placed in the oral cavity to release the medication, which  becomes available for oromucosal absorption, without chewing and intake of water.2,4,5  Hence, it offers a convenient way for patients who cannot be dosed orally like pediatric  and geriatric patients6 and also for patients who are unable to swallow large quantity  of water, such as those suffering from dysphagia, repeated emesis, motion sickness,  and mental disorders.7 However, drugs that require high doses cannot be incorporated  into film strip due to its limited surface area.8 A loading of 62.5 mg of simethicone per correspondence: gihan Fetih Department of Pharmaceutics,  Faculty of Pharmacy, assiut University,  assiut, 71526, egypt Tel +20 10 0557 3833 Fax +20 88 2080 711 email gfetih@yahoo.co m Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Allam and Fetih Running head recto: Metoprolol tartrate sublingual fast dissolving niosomal film DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S113775",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/58/dddt-10-2421.PMC4977085.pdf

"Keywords:  cycloid psychoses, schizophrenia, glutamate, glycine, tryptophan, neuroplasticity Introduction Over many decades, dopamine (DA) neurotransmission has been thought to be the  main mechanism in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders, and DA receptor  antagonists have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing – mainly positive –  psychotic symptoms.1 Subsequent research has disclosed that other neurotransmitter  systems, particularly that of glutamate, are associated with negative symptoms and  cognitive dysfunctions via the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.2–5 Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in human brain, and  glutamatergic receptors are involved in regulating neuronal migration, growth, and  pruning (ie, neuroplasticity).6,7 Glutamate acts at different types of receptors, of which  the NMDA receptor is the most investigated.8,9 Glycine acts as a co-agonist at the  NMDA receptor and can potentiate glutamatergic neurotransmission.10 In contrast, correspondence: Nora Wa van de  Kerkhof Vincent van gogh institute for  Psychiatry, centre of excellence for  Neuropsychiatry, stationsweg 46, 5803  ac Venray, The Netherlands Tel +31 478 52 7339 Fax +31 478 52 7111 email nvandekerkhof@vvgi.n l Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: van de Kerkhof et al Running head recto: Biochemistry of cycloid psychoses DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S101317",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/14/32/ndt-12-1927.PMC4977096.pdf
