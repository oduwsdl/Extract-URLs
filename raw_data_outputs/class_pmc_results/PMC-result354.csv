"An improved  understanding of the immune system along with the discovery of tumor-associated  antigens (TAAs) has made it possible to design various immunotherapy strategies for  lung cancer.4 Folate receptor alpha (FRA), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell  surface glycoprotein, is overexpressed on the surface of various tumor types, including  pancreatic, prostate, head and neck, breast, and ovarian cancer (OC), mesothelioma,  as well as NSCLC.5–13 Folic acid (an essential B vitamin) is necessary for proper cell  growth and one-carbon transfer processes mediated by numerous enzymes that are  involved in DNA synthesis.14 FRA binds folic acid with high affinity and mediates  its intracellular transport via receptor-mediated endocytosis.15 The expression of  FRA allows epithelial tumor cells to proliferate suggesting that FRA is an acquired  tumor cell proliferation, tumor biology, and patient prognosis marker.6,12,16–18 Several  studies have suggested that levels of FRA expression are associated with tumor stage  and survival in lung AC.8,13 FRA has a much more limited normal tissue distribution,  with measurable expression restricted largely to the apical surfaces of the epithelial Correspondence: Zhehai wang Department of Oncology, Shandong  Cancer Hospital and institute,  No 440 Jiyan Road, Jinan 250117,  Shandong, People’s Republic of China Tel/fax +86 531 6762 6331 email wzhai8778@yahoo.co m Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Shi et al Running head recto: Folate receptor alpha in lung cancer DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S90670",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/78/4a/dddt-9-4989.PMC4560517.pdf

Sequence parameters for the 3D volumetric T1-weighted images were: repetition time (TR) 36 ms; echo time (TE) 9.2 ms; ﬂip angle 30° and voxel size 1 mm × 1.04 mm × 1.04 mm for both sagittal and coronal acquisitions.The 7 sagittal T1-weighted images were pre-processed to be in the same orientation of the 315 coronal acquisitions using MINC image process- ing tools ( http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/HomePage ).,OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b2/2f/main.PMC4561668.pdf

"Keywords:  exfoliation syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, exfoliation glaucoma, glau - coma capsulare Introduction Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) is thought to be an ocular manifestation of a  systemic extracellular matrix disorder characterized by accumulation of fibrillar  material in tissues, including ocular tissues.1–5 It is characterized by the presence of  small, white pseudoexfoliative material in the anterior segment, predominantly on the  pupillary margin and anterior lens capsule.6 The association between PXF and glaucoma is well recognized.3,7 In fact, PXF  has been described as the most common identifiable cause of open-angle glaucoma  worldwide.8 Studies have also shown that glaucomatous damage progresses more rapidly  in patients with PXF and glaucoma when compared with those having chronic open-angle  glaucoma.9–14 Visual field defects have also been shown to be more severe at the time of  diagnosis in patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXG)11,15 and to deteriorate more  rapidly when compared with chronic open-angle glaucoma.16 Cataracts have been reported  to be more common in PXF patients,17,18 and PXF has also been shown to be associated  with zonulysis during cataract surgery as well as postoperative lens dislocation.8,19 PXF is an age-related disease with significant geographic and racial variations in  prevalence.20–23 Population-based studies have reported prevalence rates of PXF world - wide varying from 0%24 to over 40%.20,21,24 The prevalence of PXF has been reported  in various parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.25–41Correspondence: Jason Kian seng lee national healthcare group eye institute,  Tan Tock seng hospital, 11, Jalan Tan  Tock seng, singapore 308433 Tel +65 6357 7726 Fax +65 6357 8675 email j ason_ks_lee@ttsh.com.s g Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Lee et al Running head recto: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome at a Singapore eye clinic DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S87155",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/c9/f2/opth-9-1619.PMC4562725.pdf

"Currently, the development of innovative technologies in ge - nomic and proteomic analysis of HBV-related chronic hepatic  diseases might bring great hopes that the techniques not only  contribute to our understanding of the diseases, but also help  to develop diagnostic markers that could assist the clinicians in  their management.4 At present, it has become relatively easy to  detect the protein profiling in the crude biological samples with  surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass  spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).5 The most common use of the  SELDI-TOF MS today is in biomarker researches by comparing  serum proteins between healthy and diseased individuals.6,7 This  is a high-throughput technical platform which can detect mul - tiple protein changes simultaneously with high sensitivity and  specificity.8,9 In the present study, by comparing analysis among normal   This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0)  which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/3b/4b/gnl-09-665.PMC4562785.pdf

"Given these advantages, coupled with the fact that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is cost-effective and easily accessible in re- positories such as Addgene ( https://www.addgene.org/ ), this system has led to an exponential increase in genome engineering of cells and model organisms to study disease biology.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/32/ca/main.PMC4563028.pdf

"Some strategies involving the opti- mization of the guide RNA/Cas9 include using of software tools to predict potential off-target sites ( http://omictools.com/crispr-cas9- c1268-p1.html ), truncating the guide RNA ( <20 nucleotides) to decrease off-target mutagenesis [30], lowering the dosage of guide RNA and Cas9 plasmids, and decreasing the number of mismatches between the guide RNA and the genomic DNA.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/32/ca/main.PMC4563028.pdf
