"ICA terminus occlusions are  rarely recanalized with intravenous (IV) thrombolytic therapy alone, and adjunctive endovascular treatment has been proposed  as more appropriate to achieve improved recanalization.1,4 Prior  studies on intra-arterial (IA) thrombolytics found that while they  resulted in a substantial recanalization rate, they were associat - ed with a high rate of hemorrhagic transformation and low rates  of good clinical outcomes, similar to IV treatment alone.2,5 One  study found that mechanical thrombectomy devices were more  effective than IA urokinase infusion for recanalization, but they Journal of Stroke  201 6;18(2):179- 186 http://dx.doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.01529",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/9f/bb/jos-2015-01529.PMC4901942.pdf

"Keywords Ischemic stroke; Heart transplantation; Inflammation; Cardioembolism; P wave dispersion;  HomocysteineReview Introduction Stroke is a heterogeneous disease with more than 150 known  causes,1 representing the fourth leading cause of death in the  United States after heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower re - spiratory diseases.2 After orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT),  stroke represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality de - spite successful transplantation.3 OHT is currently the gold stan - dard therapy for end-stage heart failure, refractory to medical  treatment.4 Graft complications and infections are the main  causes of mortality, but advancements in the fields of immuno - suppression, infection prophylaxis, and surgical techniques have transformed OHT from what was once considered an experimen - tal intervention into a routine treatment,5 with a survival rate at  5 years greater than 70 percent.6 Neurologic sequelae after OHT  are similar to the complications associated with valvular or by - pass graft surgery,7 but perioperative cerebrovascular complica - tions are more common after cardiac transplantation compared  to routine cardiac surgery.8 Ischemic stroke and transient isch - emic attack (TIA) represent the most common cerebrovascular  complications after cardiac transplantation, with an incidence of  up to 13%,9 instead intracranial hemorrhage is an infrequent  cause of stroke (2.5%) (Table 1).7,10 Journal of Stroke  201 6;18(2):157- 168 http://dx.doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.01599",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/70/81/jos-2015-01599.PMC4901943.pdf

"The corticospinal tract  (CST) is the primary motor pathway in the central nervous sys - tem, and many studies indicate that CST preservation is essential for good recovery of impaired motor function in patients follow - ing stroke.1,2 Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), which can be ob - tained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor  cortex, are used to study various central nervous system disor - ders.3 The absence or low amplitude of TMS responses suggests  loss of neurons or axons in the CST, which can be used as an  early stage prognostic indicator of motor and functional recovery  in patients with stroke.4-7 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a  method for visualizing anisotropic water molecule diffusion  characteristics in the white matter of the brain.8 More specifi - cally, DTI visualizes the diffusion of water molecules along axo -Journal of Stroke  201 6;18(2):220- 226 http://dx.doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.01767",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/27/2e/jos-2015-01767.PMC4901949.pdf
