"Keywords:  mobility, cognition, lacunar stroke, training, rehabilitation, neuronal plasticity Introduction There are reports that physical training may have positive effects even with more  advanced age and in the chronic phase of a stroke.1 Such effects have been shown not only  concerning mobility but also for cognition, and it has been suggested that training may  partially normalize brain activation in motor networks after stroke.2 In contrast, especially  increased contralesional and extramotor network activations have been correlated with  decreased motor abilities.3,4 Previously termed lacunar infarcts (now preferably called  recent small subcortical infarcts)5 represent a  morphologically well-characterized subtype  of stroke that may cause such impairments in mobility and cognition.1,6,7 More than 60%  of patients with lacunar stroke still have motor dysfunction after 12 months.8 In contrast to other studies, we thus examined training effects on mobility and cog - nition in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with lacunar stroke, because this patient  group has a higher chance for intact compensatory networks and residual impairments Correspondence: Daniela Pinter Research Unit for Neuronal Repair and   Plasticity, Department of Neurology,  Medical University of Graz,  Auenbruggerplatz 22, 8036 graz, Austria Tel +43 316 385 16437 email daniela.pinter@medunigraz.a t Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Landsmann et al Running head recto: Repeated fMRI and effects of training in chronic stroke DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S95632",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/94/8b/cia-11-097.PMC4734728.pdf
