"Keywords:  urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus, epidemiology, incidence Introduction Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are more prone to develop infections compared  with the general population,1 with urinary tract infections (UTIs) being among the  most commonly encountered.2 It has been estimated that UTIs account for 7 million hospital visits per year, along  with 1 million visits to the emergency department, in the United States,2 involving an  estimated annual cost of ~US$1.6 billion to the health care system.3 Several factors contribute to an increased infection risk in patients with DM:  defects in the host immune defense mechanisms (such as impaired neutrophil func - tion, decreased T-cell-mediated immune response, low levels of prostaglandin E,  thromboxane B2, leukotriene B4),4 incomplete bladder emptying due to autonomic  neuropathy, and poor metabolic control.5,6 A higher glucose concentration in the urine  allows urinary colonization by pathogenic microorganisms.4,5 Various types of UTIs may develop in patients with DM: asymptomatic bacteriuria  (ASB), lower UTI (cystitis), upper UTI (pyelonephritis), and severe urosepsis, requiring Correspondence: Bogdan Timar Victor Babes University of Medicine and  Pharmacy Timisoara, 2 eftimie Murgu,  Timisoara 300041, Romania Tel +40 741 528 093 Fax +40 256 462 856 email timar.bogdan@umft.r o Journal name: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 13 Running head verso: Chi ță et al Running head recto: Urinary tract infections in diabetic patients DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S123226",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/4d/22/tcrm-13-001.PMC5179217.pdf

"Keywords arsenic; environmental exposure; infant formula; rice cereal Introduction Arsenic is a known carcinogen and suspected immunotoxicant.1 We previously reported that  infant formula can be an important source of arsenic exposure, especially when reconstituted  with arsenic-contaminated water.2 However, solid foods are also a potential source of  arsenic, especially those containing rice.3-5 Infant rice cereal, often the first solid food an  infant recieves, has been reported to contain elevated concentrations of arsenic.6-8 This is  potentially of concern because early life is a period of both heighted vulnerability to arsenic9  and high dietary intake relative to adults.10 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/da/6b/nihms832054.PMC5179225.pdf

"Despite the different cel - lular origin, there is considerable overlap between T-LGLL and CLPD-NK in terms  of clinical presentation and response to therapy.6,7 T-LGLL and CLPD-NK are indolent diseases frequently associated with cytopenias  and a wide spectrum of autoimmune manifestations.8 Neutropenia can lead to recur - rent bacterial infections, representing an indication for treatment initiation in most of  the cases.9 Immunosuppressive therapies are usually used in this context, including  methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine.10 With the advent of potential new therapeutic options, a recent surge in the inter - est for the pathophysiology of these diseases is noted.5 We here report an uncommon  presentation of T-LGLL, where the diagnosis was missed because of the lack of the  typical appearance of circulating and bone marrow LGLs.Correspondence: Mihnea Zdrenghea Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta  Oncology Institute, 73, 21 Decembrie  Boulevard, 400124 Cluj-Napoca, romania Tel +40 741 100 480 Fax +40 264 598 606 email mzdrenghea@umfcluj.r oJournal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Case report Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Bagacean et al Running head recto: Aleukemic large granular lymphocytic leukemia DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S115892",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/2c/ed/ott-10-031.PMC5182032.pdf

"Keywords:  chitosan, colon-specific delivery, acidification, microflora, factorial design,  controlled release Introduction Developing a colon-specific drug delivery system (CDDS) has garnered significant  attention, owing to the distinct characteristics of the colon, such as neutral pH, longer  transit time, reduced digestive enzymatic activity, and a greater responsiveness to  absorption enhancers.1 A CDDS possesses practical implications for the treatment of  bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and colon cancer, and the  systemic delivery of protein and peptide drugs that are labile and poorly absorbed in  the gastrointestinal tract.2 Various approaches for targeting drugs to the colon have been widely investigated,  including the pH-sensitive polymer-based system, the time-dependent system, and the  pressure-dependent release system.3–5 However, the similarity in pH between the small  intestine and colon and high variations in gastrointestinal retention time rendered the  aforementioned approaches less reliable for colon targeting.6 In contrast, the colonic  microflora-activated system has been considered as an alternative approach, since this  strategy exploits the distinctive colonic characteristic of abrupt increase in bacterial  population and associated enzyme activities, thus accomplishing greater site specific - ity of drug release.7,8 The microflora population of the colon is normally in the range  of 1011–1012 CFU/mL, while that of the intestine is fewer than 103–104 CFU/mL.9  The use of polysaccharides that are biodegraded by colonic microflora could result in  comparatively safer and more effective delivery of drugs to the colon.9,10correspondence: Young Wook choi college of Pharmacy, chung-ang  University, 221 heuksuk-dong,  Dongjak-gu, seoul 156756, south Korea Tel +82 2 820 5609 Fax +82 2 826 3781 email ywchoi@cau.ac.k r Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Kim et al Running head recto: Development of a chitosan based double layer-coated tablet DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S123412",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/16/e8/dddt-11-045.PMC5191854.pdf

Introduction The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a confedera- tion of 10 sovereign states occupying approximately 1.7 million square miles of Southeast Asia with an estimated population of just under 630 million ( https://www.usasean.org/why-asean/what-is-asean ).,Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/23/47/main.PMC5192237.pdf
"Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) has a population of 6.8 million and has a reported annual cervical cancer inci- dence of 22.1 per 100,000 and an annual cervical cancer mortality of 13.3 per 100,000 ( http://globalcancermap.com ).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/23/47/main.PMC5192237.pdf
The primary drivers of growth in these countries is relative political stability and govern- ments that are committed to joining the global economy and thereforeactively rolling back decades of isolationism ( https://www.cia.gov/ library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html ;https://www.,Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/23/47/main.PMC5192237.pdf
