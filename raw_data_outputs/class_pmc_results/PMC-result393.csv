"Keywords:  Stickler syndrome, retinopexy, Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, ocular genetics, arthro- ophthalmopathy, collagen disorder Introduction Stickler syndrome was originally described in 1965 as an autosomal-dominant  arthro-ophthalmopathy with predominant ophthalmic, orofacial, auditory, and articular  manifestations.1 It is a collagen disorder of the connective tissue and is the most  common disorder of hereditary vitreous abnormalities with an incidence of ~1:10,000  births.2,3 Stickler syndrome is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and  COL11A2 genes.3 A recessive form of Stickler syndrome with COL9A1 gene mutation  has been described.4,5 Ocular features of Stickler syndrome include myopia, glaucoma,  and retinal detachment (RD).4–7 Patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome are at a high  risk of visual loss from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), particularly from  a giant retinal tear that often occurs before 30 years of age.8–10 The presence of multiple breaks and liquefied abnormal vitreous complicates the  management of Stickler syndrome patients.11,12 Previous literature has shown that RRD  in Stickler syndrome is complex and consistently difficult to manage, with a lower  success rate of repair compared with the typical degenerative RRD in non-Stickler Correspondence: saba al-rashaed Vitreoretinal Department, King Khaled  eye specialist hospital, PO Box 7191,  riyadh 11462, Kingdom of saudi arabia Tel +966 1 482 1234 Fax +966 1 482 1234 ext 3727 email srashaed@kkesh.med.s a Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Alshahrani et al Running head recto: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated to Stickler syndrome DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S91444",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/80/7a/opth-10-001.PMC4697790.pdf

"The highest incidence rates were observed in Eastern Asia  and in Eastern and Southern Africa.1 The low survival rate of patients with esophageal  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with a 5-year survival rate of only 20%–40%, has  encouraged many studies to investigate targeted therapy.2,3 The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), detected in 50%–70%  of esophageal cancer cases, correlates with poor prognosis.4–7 Thus, EGFR antagonists have  been widely investigated in experimental and clinical trials; in particular, certain EGFR  antagonists such as cetuximab and gefitinib have been investigated in the REAL3 and  COG trials.8–10 According to the reports of several phase III clinical trials in which regimen  combining cetuximab and conventional chemoradiotherapy was investigated, unsatisfac - tory efficacy performance and frequently recorded grade 3 or 4 toxicity events, notably  rashes and diarrhea induced by cetuximab, are major concerns to resolve before applying  this monoclonal antibody into real-life clinical management of esophageal cancer.8,11 Phase I/II clinical trials have shown that nimotuzumab (h-R3) as a humanized  monoclonal antibody effectively targets the EGFR with limited side effects in  epithelial correspondence: Kuaile Zhao;   guoliang Jiang Department of radiation Oncology,  Fudan University shanghai cancer  center, 270 Dong an road, shanghai  200032, People’s republic of china Tel +86 21 6443 9052 Fax +86 21 6443 9052 email kuaile_z@sina.co m;   guoliang.jiang@sphic.org.c n Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Wang et al Running head recto: Dose effect of nimotuzumab on esophageal cancer DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S89592",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/c0/97/ott-9-117.PMC4699509.pdf
