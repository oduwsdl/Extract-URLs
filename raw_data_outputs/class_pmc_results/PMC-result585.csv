"Eating  patterns that traditionally have been  considered MEPs have the following common characteristics, which indi - vidually or in combination improve cardiometabolic health (7,8):• Plant-based: abundant in fruits and vegetables; breads and other  forms of cereals; and beans, nuts  and seeds • Minimally processed: originally, the MEP was an eating pattern of the poor and, as such, it includes  locally grown, seasonally fresh  foods • Limited sweets: fresh fruits are the  typical daily dessert, with sweets  based on nuts and made with olive oil  • High-quality fats: olive oil is the  primary source of fat, and total  intake is moderate (30%) to high (40%) of total energy intakeMediterranean Eating Pattern Jackie L.

"Keywords:  metal nanoparticle, inflammatory response, SIRT1, NF- κB, aseptic loosening Introduction Aseptic loosening is the most common cause of total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure,  and osteolysis induced by wear particles plays a vital role in its pathological processes.1  Among various nanoparticles generated from implant components, metal particles,  such as TiAl6V4 particles (TiPs) and CoCrMo particles (CoPs), are among the most  common materials to be studied due to the wide use of metal prostheses in clinical  practice.2 Briefly, nanoparticles generated from implant components stimulate local  macrophages and mesenchymal cells to release a multitude of cytokines, chemokines,  and metalloproteinases,3,4 which subsequently activate osteoclasts and result in bone  resorption.5 Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- α  (TNF- α) and interleukin (IL)-1 β, modulate the balance between osteoblast and osteo - clast activities and promote osteolysis.6–9 The induction of osteolysis by CoPs could  be prevented by the suppression of TNF- α in a murine calvaria osteolysis model.10  Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a mediator in the inflammatory responses induced  by both TiPs and CoPs in osteolysis.4 However, a specific target for the effective correspondence: Qian gao Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular  Medicine, school of Medicine,  Nanjing University, No 22, Hankou  road, Nanjing 210002, Jiangsu,  People’s republic of china email qian_gao@nju.edu.c n  Jianning Zhao Department of Orthopedics, Jinling  hospital, school of Medicine, Nanjing  University, No 305, Zhongshan  east road, Nanjing 210002, Jiangsu,  People’s republic of china email zhaojianning.0207@163.co m Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Deng et al Running head recto: SIRT1 regulates nanoparticle-induced inflammation DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S124661",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/fb/5b/ijn-12-3617.PMC5439723.pdf

"Keywords:  depression, dry eye disease, neurological disorder, neuropathic pain, psychiatric  disorders, sleep disorder Introduction Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ophthalmologic disorders.1 It is  associated with symptoms including ocular discomfort, pain, dryness and foreign body  sensation, which can impair the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.1 In terms  of economic burden, DED has become a major public health problem.2 DED poses  an average cost of $11,302 per patient and an estimated overall cost of $55.4 billion  to the US society annually.3 DED becomes more prevalent with increasing age.4–6 In a male population  aged $50 years in the US, the prevalence of DED increased with age, from 3.90% among  men of 50–54 years of age to 7.67% among men $80 years of age.7 Similarly, among  adult US women, DED prevalence increased from 5.7% in a group ,50 years of age  to 9.8% in a group $75 years of age.8 The prevalence of DED in an adult population  of age $50 years in the US was reported to be 4.34%, or 1.68 million, among males,  and 7.8%, or 3.23 million, among female subjects.7,8 Our previous study revealed  that the prevalence of DED in an elderly Korean population of age $65 years was  33.2%.9 Thus, with elongation of life expectancy, the economic burden of DED on  both a patient and the society is expected to be increasing,10 which underscores the  importance of the understanding of the pathogenesis of and development of effective  treatment methods for DED in elderly patients.Correspondence: Joon Young Hyon Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul  National University Bundang Hospital,  300 Gumi-dong, Bundang-gu, Seongnam,  Gyeonggi 463-707, Republic of Korea Tel +82 31 787 7379 Fax +82 31 787 4057 email jyhyon@snu.ac.k r Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Han et al Running head recto: Dry eye disease and psychiatric/neurological conditions in the elderly DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S137580",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/f9/16/cia-12-785.PMC5439727.pdf
