"Keywords:  word associations, colors, stress, synesthesia, temporal lobe epilepsy, limbic  irritability Introduction Temporal lobe epilepsy represents the neurological pathological condition, which  is also related to a wide spectrum of psychopathological symptoms that manifest as  various sensory distortions, hallucinatory experiences, depersonalization, derealization  and other psychosensory, and affective symptoms usually reported in patients with  temporal lobe epilepsy.1–4 Recent research indicates that these symptoms may occur  as a continuum of complex partial seizure-like symptoms also in patients with mental  disorders and in the normal population.1,4 Some data also show that these symptoms  may be related to stressful and traumatic experiences that may influence inhibitory func - tions and neural excitability mainly in the limbic system.1–3 Several findings also show  that temporal lobe seizures or seizure-like conditions may manifest in various unusual  cross-sensory links and unusual associative connections that may cause synesthetic  phenomena.5,6 Synesthesia is a phenomenon related to various forms of inter-sensory  connections, for example, hearing a sound may evoke seeing a color.5,7,8 According to recent findings, synesthesia in its mild forms may have relatively  high prevalence in the population, which according to some reported data may be  at approximately 30%–50%.7,9 Recent studies indicate that the phenomenon of the correspondence: Petr Bob center for Neuropsychiatric research  of Traumatic stress, Department of  Psychiatry, First Faculty of Medicine,  charles University, Ke Karlovu 11, 12000  Prague 2, czech republic email petrbob@netscape.ne tJournal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Neckar and Bob Running head recto: Synesthetic associations and psychosensory symptoms DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S95464",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/fd/f8/ndt-12-109.PMC4714732.pdf

"Keywords:  schizophrenia, cariprazine, pharmacokinetics, desmethyl-cariprazine, didesmethyl- cariprazine Introduction Schizophrenia is a complex disorder associated with positive, negative, and mood  symptoms as well as neurocognitive impairment.1 The mainstay of treatment for  schizophrenia are antipsychotics, which act to modulate neurotransmitter function in  order to decrease the frequency and severity of psychotic episodes.2 First-generation  or typical antipsychotics are efficacious in reducing the positive symptoms of schizo - phrenia but have shown limited efficacy for treating negative symptoms or cognitive  impairment; additionally, typical antipsychotics were associated with substantial risk  of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).3 Second-generation or atypical antipsychotics  are thought to have a lower risk of EPS and better, though still limited, efficacy in  negative symptoms and cognitive deficits.3,4 All clinically effective antipsychotics show some affinity for the dopamine D2  receptor,5 but their affinity to other receptors may play an important role in their clinical correspondence: Tadakatsu nakamura 17-10, nihonbashi-Koamicho, chuo-ku,  Tokyo, Japan Tel +81 3 6748 7763 Fax +81 3 3663 6449 email nakamura.tadakatsu@ma.mt- pharma.co.j p Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Nakamura et al Running head recto: Clinical pharmacology study of cariprazine (MP-214) DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S95100",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/30/34/dddt-10-327.PMC4716719.pdf
