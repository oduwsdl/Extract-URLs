A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is aDNA sequence variation that occurs when a single nucleiotide inthe genome differs at an appreciable frequency in the population.More than 100 mutations of different types have been reported (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/gene.php?gene=GJB2) and thespectrum of mutations varies greatly among the different popu-lations with population-specific founder mutations (2-7).,Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/4a/ceo-3-65.PMC2896735.pdf
"Indeed,several nonsynonymous SVs of the GJB2 gene have been deemed SNPs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), while someof them were reported to be mutations (10).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/4a/ceo-3-65.PMC2896735.pdf
"Not only are themutation spectrums different between European descendantsand Asian populations, but also the common SNPs and their fre-quencies are strikingly different between the two ethnic groupsaccording to the genotype data from four populations and that isavailable at the International Haplotype Mapping Project (HapMap project; http://www.hapmap.org/).",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/4a/ceo-3-65.PMC2896735.pdf

"Although its disease association has been contro-versial, the occurrence of homozygous E114G in a sufficientnumber of control individuals in this study, as well as in otherstudies, strongly supports its polymorphic nature (4, 16, 18).According to the HapMap project and the dbSNP database atthe NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/),V27I and E114G are haplotype-tagging SNPs.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/4a/ceo-3-65.PMC2896735.pdf
