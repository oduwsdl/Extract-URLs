"The noncompliance rate in glaucoma patients was reported to be as high as 59% in a  systematic review.1 The reasons for poor compliance to topical medications can be due  to difficulty in administering eye drops, complex treatment regimes, poor comprehen - sion on the part of patients, lack of confidence in their ophthalmologist’s advice, and  simple forgetfulness.2 Furthermore, studies on persistency, which measure prescription  refills and refill times, have shown that less than 50% of glaucoma subjects continue  therapy and refill prescriptions as required.3 A pharmacy study has reported persis - tency to be lower in the Singapore population compared to that previously reported in  Caucasians, being 11.5% after 3 years.4 Suboptimal medical management of glaucoma  due to poor adherence and persistence can lead to a greater socioeconomic burden of  blindness, which has implications for patients and health care systems.5Correspondence: shamira a Perera singapore national eye Centre, 11 Third  hospital avenue, singapore 168751 Tel +65 6227 7255 Fax +65 6226 3395 email shamira.perera@snec.com.s g Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Perera et al Running head recto: Feasibility study of sustained-release travoprost punctum plug DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S102181",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/ac/9e/opth-10-757.PMC4854420.pdf
