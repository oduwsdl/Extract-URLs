"Keywords:  gastrointestinal, osteoporosis, postmenopausal women, treatment initiation Introduction Over one-quarter of women aged 70 or older in the US are estimated to have osteo - porosis (OP) and women account for nearly 90% of all OP cases in this age group.1  Fragility fractures are the most serious consequence of OP and are more common in  older patients than in their younger counterparts,2,3 affecting as many as 40% of those  who are 85 years and older.2 OP-related fractures result in significant health care costs4  and they have been shown to adversely affect health-related quality of life.5 Available treatments shown to reduce fracture risk include bisphosphonates  (BIS) (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid), polypeptide hor - mone (calcitonin), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (raloxifene), a receptor  activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitor (denosumab), and parathyroid  hormone 1–34 (teriparatide).6 Based on recommendations from the National Correspondence: Ankita Modi Center for Observational and real- World evidence (COre) supporting  Bone Products, Merck & Co., Inc.,  600 Corporate Drive, Mailstop CrB-205,  lebanon, nJ 08833, UsA Tel +1 908 236 4563 email ankita.modi@merck.co m Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Siris et al Running head recto: Undertreatment of osteoporosis DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S83488",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a0/e3/cia-10-1813.PMC4639522.pdf

"Keywords:  non-small-cell lung cancer, CT-guided microwave ablation, progression-free  survival, overall survival Introduction Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, with an  incidence of approximately 1.8 million and mortality of 1.59 million each year.1 Only  16.8% of all lung cancer patients survive more than 5 years after the lung cancer was  diagnosed.2 This dismal outcome is mainly because only 15% of patients are initially  diagnosed at an early stage without severe comorbidity, thus are eligible for radical  surgery.3 Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 89% of lung cancer   cases.4 Systemic therapy is recommended for advanced NSCLC according to National  Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.5 However, conventional first-line treat - ment has generated a plateau in response rate of 25%–35%, median progression-free correspondence: Jun-Qing han Department of Oncology, shandong  Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong  University, 324 Jingwuweiqi road, Jinan  250021, People’s republic of china email hanjqingsd@yeah.ne t Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 8 Running head verso: Ni et al Running head recto: Percutaneous CT-guided microwave ablation for NSCLC DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S90528",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/b3/37/ott-8-3227.PMC4640441.pdf
