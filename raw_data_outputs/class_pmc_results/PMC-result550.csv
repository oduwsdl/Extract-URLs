"Keywords:  pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive, lung volume measurements, forced expira - tory volume, cohort studies Introduction COPD is a chronic respiratory disease that is characterized by an airflow limitation that  is not fully reversible.1 It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.2  Since the 1970s, it has been widely accepted that COPD patients show an accelerated  and progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).3 Nevertheless,  recent studies have revealed that the rate of decline in FEV1 varies among individual  patients.4,5 Another important feature of COPD is lung hyperinflation, which is caused by  emphysematous parenchymal destruction and expiratory flow limitation.6 It has been  shown that lung hyperinflation contributes to symptoms, exercise intolerance, acute  exacerbations, and mortality.7–9 Although some studies assessed the rate of decline in  FEV1, data illustrating the process of lung hyperinflation development and progression  over time are rare.1,3–5,10Correspondence: ho Il Yoon Division of Pulmonary and Critical  Care Medicine, Department of Internal  Medicine, seoul national University  Bundang hospital, 82, gumi-ro 173  Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, seongnam-si,  gyeonggi-Do 13620, south Korea Tel +82 31 787 7036 Fax +82 31 787 4052 email dextro@snubh.orgJournal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Park et al Running head recto: Changes in lung hyperinflation over time in COPD DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S122909",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/5d/b8/copd-12-501.PMC5304991.pdf

"Kim and Bae Management of Intracerebral Hemorrhage https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2016.01935 32 http://j-stroke.orgAs the optimal timing for resumption of anticoagulation after  anticoagulation-related ICH is unknown, the risk of both cardio - embolic events and recurrent anticoagulation-related ICH should  be considered together in determining the starting time of anti - coagulation.45,46 In general, resumption of VKA within the first  month is associated with a high risk of recurrent ICH.47 Therefore,  a delay of at least 1 month should be suggested in patients with  VKA-related ICH.4 However, early resumption of anticoagulation  may be needed in patients with prosthetic heart valves because  of the high risk of cardioembolic events.4 In patients with lobar  ICH, resumption of anticoagulation is reported to be associated  with higher risk of recurrent ICH compared with deep hemi - spheric hemorrhage (1-year risk of recurrence, 15% versus  2.1%).48,49 Therefore, avoidance of long-term anticoagulation  with VKA as a treatment for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is  probably recommended in patients with VKA-associated lobar  ICH.4 The safety of antiplatelet agents as alternatives to VKA in  patients with lobar ICH is controversial.50,51 In patients with non- lobar ICH, antiplatelet monotherapy can be a safer alternative to  VKA in some patients with atrial fibrillation.4,51,52 As alternatives  to VKA after ICH, the usefulness of NOACs including dabigatran,  rivaroxaban, and apixaban, remains unknown.4,53-55 Antiplatelet medication-related intracerebral  hemorrhage The effect of antiplatelet drugs on the outcome of ICH is un - certain.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/8a/bd/jos-2016-01935.PMC5307946.pdf

"Keywords:  colorectal cancer, CUL4A, EMT, migration, H3K4 trimethylation Introduction In 2013, colorectal cancer (CRC) was the third most common cancer and the fourth  leading cause of death worldwide.1 An increasing number of oncogenes have been  reported to be responsible for the development of CRC, such as S100P, K-Ras, BRAF,  visfatin, and pinin.2–6 Primary CRC derives from the epithelial cells of the gastroin - testinal tract.7 During epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression, cancer  cells are thought to acquire a phenotype of the mesenchymal cell, which allows them  to lose their junctions, invade surrounding tissues, and migrate to distant organs.7 EMT  is initiated by a set of transcription factors, such as Snail, Twist1, and ZEB, which  execute EMT by repressing epithelial genes and activating mesenchymal genes.8  H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is a prevalent mark that is exclusively associated  with actively transcribed genes, whereas trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) is  associated with gene repression.9 CUL4A is a member of the evolutionally conserved cullin family, which is evolutionally  conserved and includes seven-related cullins (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, Cul5,  and Cul7).10 CUL4A constitutes the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex, and plays crucial correspondence: sumei Fan Geriatric Department, The Affiliated  huai’an hospital of Xuzhou Medical  University, 62 south huaihai road,  Qingpu, huai’an, Jiangsu 223001, People’s  republic of china Tel +86 139 1511 8811 email fansmxzmu@163.co m  Wei Zhao clinical laboratory, Obstetrics and  Gynecology Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing  Medical University, 123 Tianfeixiang,  Mochou road, Qinhuai, nanjing, Jiangsu  210004, People’s republic of china Tel +86 136 0146 8652 email weizhao_smart001@126.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Sui et al Running head recto: CUL4A promotes proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S118897",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/69/1b/ott-10-735.PMC5308582.pdf
