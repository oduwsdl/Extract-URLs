"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene  expression posttranscriptionally by directly binding their 3 ′-untranslated region (3 ′-UTR)  of mRNA.4 An increasing number of studies confirm that miRNAs play a central role in  inflammation, invasiveness, and progression in CRC.5–9 Epithelial–mesenchymal transi - tion (EMT) plays an essential role in cancer invasion and metastasis in CRC.10 During the  EMT process, cancer cells lose the expression of adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin,  and increase the expression of mesenchymal phenotype markers such as vimentin and  the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family.11 The downregulation of E-cadherin is  normally considered to be the hallmark of EMT, which can be mediated by its transcrip - tional repression through the binding of EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs),12 such  as Twist, Snail, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2.13 MMPs have been identified as key enzymes in  the EMT process as they are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix components,  specifically basement membrane, proteoglycan, fibronectin, and collagen.14correspondence: Yong-chuan Deng Department of surgical Oncology,  Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang  University school of Medicine,  no 88 Jiefang road, hangzhou 310009,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 023 6369 3840 email 149956847@qq.co m  Yun-hao Tang Department of gastrointestinal  Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of  chongqing Medical University, no 76  linjiang road, chongqing 400010,  People’s republic of china email qishi5114@126.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Cai et al Running head recto: MiR-194 modulates EMT in CRC DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S125172",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/da/41/ott-10-1269.PMC5338959.pdf

"Keywords:  epithelial ovarian cancer, lncRNA, WWOX , RP11-190D6.2, metastasis Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most common genital system tumors that  leads to cancer-related death among females.1 Recently, its high mortality rate world - wide among various types of gynecological malignancy has become a serious threat to  female health due to the difficulties in early diagnosis and poor treatment.2 It has been  proven that a large portion of the human genome can be transcribed into noncoding  RNAs (ncRNAs).3 Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are one type of ncRNAs whose transcripts   are longer than 200 nucleotides and have no protein-coding capacity.3 lncRNAs are  dissimilar to miRNAs or else other smaller noncoding RNAs because they can regulate  the downstream target gene at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by various  means of cis and trans regulation.4,5 In recent years, many studies have demonstrated  that lncRNAs play crucial roles in human diseases and various cancers.6–8 Particularly, correspondence: anbing he Department of Oncology, The Fifth  hospital of Wuhan, number 122,  Xianzheng street, hanyang District,  Wuhan 430050, hubei Province,  People’s republic of china email cellularen@sohu.co m  Jie Yao cancer center, chinese Pla general  hospital, number 28, Fuxing road,  haidian District, Beijing 100039,  People’s republic of china email jackyao99520@163.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Tong et al Running head recto: New tumor suppressor lncRNA RP11-190D6.2 inhibits proliferation DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S125185",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/aa/0f/ott-10-1227.PMC5338983.pdf

"The World Health Organization  estimates that 8.2 million people died of cancer in 2012, and this figure is expected to  increase to 13 million annually within the next 2 decades.1 The ultimate goal of cancer  therapeutics is to prolong the survival time and improve the quality of life of  patients by minimizing systemic toxicity and maximizing the anticancer efficacy of  chemotherapy.2,3 Combining anticancer therapies with antiangiogenic therapies is  becoming increasingly important since this approach can kill tumor cells directly and  cut off their oxygen and nutrient supplies.4,5 Investigators have reported that dual- targeting nanoparticles that simultaneously target both tumor vascular endothelial cells  and tumor cells inhibit the process of angiogenesis and kill the tumor cells, resulting  in an additive effect on anticancer efficacy compared with either therapy alone.6–8  However, the efficacy of combined therapy is still limited due to the evasion of cell  death and drug resistance.9–11correspondence: li li National Engineering Research Center  for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, No  29 Wangjiang Road, Chengdu 610064,  Sichuan, People’s Republic of China Tel +86 28 8541 5928 Fax +86 28 8541 0653 email li_li@scu.edu.c n Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Sun et al Running head recto: Enhanced anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S122859",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/f2/fa/ijn-12-1517.PMC5338999.pdf

"Keywords:  focus groups, HIV, vaginal practices, women, mixed methods Introduction Vaginal practices are used by large numbers of women worldwide to clean, tighten, dry  or warm the vagina to enhance hygiene, health or sex.1 Intravaginal practices (IVPs)  refer to both intravaginal cleansing (cleaning or washing inside the vagina with fingers  or other substances to remove fluids), and intravaginal insertion (placing something  inside the vagina, eg, powders, creams, or tissue).1 In the US, intravaginal cleansing  with commercial douches is common among African-Americans and Hispanics, and  is one of the primary risk factors for bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common  genital infection in women of childbearing age.2–5 BV is associated with adverse  health outcomes, eg, preterm delivery and gynecological surgery complications.2,6,7   BV has also been shown to increase the risk of acquisition and transmission of sexually  transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV.2,8–11 Likewise, IVPs, independent of BV, have  been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition.10,12–14 IVPs are therefore  important to evaluate in women with HIV and at-risk for HIV infection as they are  associated with women’s poor health outcomes and are likely implicated in both HIV  acquisition and transmission to sexual partners.correspondence: stephen M Weiss Department of Psychiatry and  Behavioral sciences, University of  Miami Miller school of Medicine  1400 nW 10th avenue, suite  404-a, Miami, Fl 33136, Usa Tel +1 305 243 2188 email sweiss2@med.miami.ed u Journal name: International Journal of Women’s Health Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Alcaide et al Running head recto: Addressing intravaginal practices in women at-risk or infected with HIV in the US DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S125883",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/72/61/ijwh-9-123.PMC5339018.pdf
