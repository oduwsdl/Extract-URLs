"Keywords:  contact lens, dry eye, hyaluronan, MPS Introduction The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is a biological polymer of repeating  glucuronic acid and N-acetyl- d-glucosamine disaccharide units present throughout the  human body.1 Its molecular structure is highly conserved in mammals; the molecule  is recognized by various cell surface receptors that signal for subsequent biological  events, particularly during development and at sites of wound healing.2 In addition,  HA is rich in chemical moieties that bind water.3 Its distribution is site specific, but  in many structures, it is colocated with CD44, a cell surface receptor for both HA  and fibronectin.4,5 Ha in the human body HA is abundant in extracellular matrix and pericellular matrix, with approximately  half present in the skin and the rest present in other anatomical locations such as  synovial fluid, umbilical cord, and the eye.6 Supplemental HA and its derivatives are Correspondence: Marjorie J rah Vision Care, Bausch & lomb  incorporated, 1400 north Goodman  Street rochester, nY 14609, USa Tel +1 585 413 6397 email marjorie.rah@bausch.co m Journal name: Clinical Ophthalmology Article Designation: Clinical Trial Report Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Scheuer et al Running head recto: Hyaluronan in tears DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S115705",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/55/29/opth-10-1945.PMC5063495.pdf

"To date, set- shifting, central coherence, and social cognition of AN patients have been explored to  discover the neurocognitive factors related to pathology of the disease.3–5 Holliday et al reported that difficulty of set-shifting in AN patients was not a con - sequence of starvation.6 Other studies also revealed that dysfunction of set-shifting  was not due to the influence of other clinical factors such as psychiatric symptoms.7  Also, as for central coherence, it is reported that AN patients have weak central coher - ence that leads to their focus on local rather than global processing, particularly in  visuospatial domain.8 Kanakam et al regarded poor ability of set-shifting and weak  central coherence as the endophenotypes of eating disorders.4 On the other hand, research on social cognition including theory of mind (ToM) is  still at initial stage and so far, divergent findings have been reported.9 Social cognition  refers to the psychological processes that are related to perception, encoding, storage,  retrieval, and regulation of information about other people and ourselves.10 ToM is the  ability to understand the mental states of other people and oneself and use this information  to predict their behavior.11 Harrison et al reported that AN patients had significantly lower  score on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes12 and more difficulties in emotion regulation  than healthy controls (HC).13 Later, they found in a study with a larger sample size that correspondence: Masahito Tomotake Department of Mental health,  institute of Biomedical sciences,  Tokushima University graduate school,  3-18-15 Kuramoto-cho, Tokushima  770-8503, Japan Tel +81 88 633 9083 Fax +81 88 633 9083 email tomotake@tokushima-u.ac.j p Journal name: Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Hamatani et al Running head recto: Social cognition in anorexia nervosa DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S116521",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/77/b9/ndt-12-2527.PMC5063555.pdf

"However, the  highly infiltrative and invasive nature of glioma cells often leads to blurred tumor  margins, resulting in incomplete tumor resection and thus tumor recurrence.4 Among the various imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is  the mainstay for clinical diagnosis of glioma due to its high temporal and spatial  resolution.5 Converging advances in the improved nanotechnology-based imaging  probes and understanding of the molecular biology of tumor offer the opportunity  to improve the visualization of brain tumor from normal tissues.6–8 As negative MR  contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have attracted tremendous attention  for glioma imaging due to their tunable sizes, large surface areas, easy modification  and considerable biocompatibility.9 Compared with gadolinium-based contrast agents  used in clinic, IONPs can offer prolonged delineation of disseminated tumor boundaries  due to their enhanced cellular uptake and slower elimination from tumor, mediated by correspondence: gang liu state Key laboratory of Molecular  Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics,  center for Molecular Imaging and  Translational Medicine, school of  Public health, Xiamen University,  Xiang’an south road, Xiang’an District,  Xiamen 361102, Fujian, People’s republic  of china Tel/fax +86 922 880 648 email gangliu.cmitm@xmu.edu.c n Weiguo Zhang Department of radiology, Daping  hospital, 10th changjiang road,  Yuzhong District, chongqing 400042,  People’s republic of china Tel +86 236 875 7621 Fax +86 236 875 7620 email wgzhang01@163.co mJournal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Liu et al Running head recto: EGF1-EGFP-IONPs for targeted glioma MR imaging DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S116980",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/08/fd/ijn-11-5099.PMC5063593.pdf

"Keywords:  COPD, socioeconomic status, low- and middle-income country Background COPD is a preventable and treatable disease defined by airflow obstruction that is not  fully reversible.1,2 The leading causes of COPD worldwide include tobacco smoking  and exposure to household air pollution from biomass fuels, although this may change  with increasing exposure to tobacco smoking particularly among low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).3 Estimates show that COPD affects 328 million people  globally, though population-based data examining the prevalence, risk factors, and  clinical outcomes of COPD are sparse outside high-income countries (HIC).4,5 A few  population-based studies have been conducted over the last decade that found a wide  variation in COPD prevalence among populations.5–7 Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the most powerful determinants of health  across a range of chronic diseases.8,9 SES is defined as an individual’s social and  economic standing and serves as proxy for social or economic position or rank Correspondence: William Checkley Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care,  school of Medicine, Johns hopkins  University, 1800 Orleans avenue, suite  9121, Baltimore, MD 21287, Usa email wcheckl1@jhmi.ed u Journal name: International Journal of COPD Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Grigsby et al Running head recto: Socioeconomic status and COPD among LMICs DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S111145",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a7/fa/copd-11-2497.PMC5065097.pdf
