"Keywords:  sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, type  2  diabetes mellitus, combination therapy Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive, multifactorial metabolic and  cardiovascular disorder characterized by multiple pathophysiologic abnormalities  (exemplified by the “Ominous Octet”).1–3 Almost half of adults with diabetes do not  achieve the recommended glucose control targets.4 This has prompted some clinicians  to consider more aggressive initial therapy, including the initial use of combination  therapy.1,5 DeFronzo and colleagues have proposed the early initiation of combination  therapy in the treatment of T2DM, using agents that correct the associated pathophysi - ologic abnormalities to produce a sustained reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).1  They further suggested that medications and treatment approaches in T2DM should  preserve or improve pancreatic β-cell function, reduce insulin resistance in muscle  and liver, have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, be weight neutral/ promote weight loss, and be safe to use.1 Drug classes selected for use in combina - tion should have complementary mechanisms of action,1,5 which may prevent the  occurrence of compensatory mechanisms and may maximize the chances of additive  effects in achieving and maintaining HbA1c goals.6 The potential use of initial com - bination therapy is recognized in the current standards of care for diabetes, but the  guidance is directed at those with more severe hyperglycemia.5 The American Diabetes  Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend that initial  combination therapy should be considered for patients with baseline HbA1c 9%.3,7 Correspondence: vanita R Aroda MedStar Health Research institute,  6525 Belcrest Road, Suite 700,  Hyattsville, MD 20782, USA Tel +1 301 560 7300 Fax +1 301 560 7348 email vanita.aroda@medstar.ne t Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Y assin and Aroda Running head recto: SGLT2 inhibitors/DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S121899",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/24/97/dddt-11-923.PMC5367741.pdf

"Keywords:  multitasking, fall, balance, cognition, rehabilitation, training, coordination Introduction Postural stability is an integral component of the motor control and coordination  process of the body, which is required for preserving steadiness during static and  dynamic activities.1 This component relies upon proprioceptive afferents and complex  sensori motor actions.2–4 Posture is mediated by both higher “controlled” and lower  “automatic” levels of processing,5,6 implying the involvement of basal ganglia–cortical  loop for higher level processing7 and brainstem synergies for lower level processing.8  Studies have suggested that any alleviation in conscious-controlled attention toward  postural control increases the likelihood of disrupting coordination and stability,9,10  possibly, as a consequence of movement-specific reinvestment.9,11 The theory of  reinvestment suggests that directing attention internally to control movement, which  is usually automatic, can disrupt its performance.9,10 The theory also suggests that Correspondence: Shashank Ghai Institut für Sportwissenschaft, Leibniz  Universität, Am Moritzwinkel 6,  Hannover 30167, Germany Tel +49 511 7621 7290 email shashank.ghai@sportwiss.uni- hannover.d e Journal name: Clinical Interventions in Aging Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2017 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Ghai et al Running head recto: Review of dual-task and dual task training on posture DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S125201",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/a7/7b/cia-12-557.PMC5367902.pdf
