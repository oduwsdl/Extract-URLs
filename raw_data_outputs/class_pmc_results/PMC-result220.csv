"However, amplification strategies are needed to overcome the inherently low sensitivity  of MRI.2–4 One of conventional strategies uses gadolinium (Gd) (III) chelates5,6 but  has been shown to have potential toxicity including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.7 In  this regard, it is thus crucial to develop efficient nanoparticles (NPs) lacking or having  minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo, including absorption, distribution, metabolism,  excretion, and immunotoxiciy.8–11 Gd2O3 is an attractive T1-weighted MRI contrast agent due to its numerous unpaired  electrons,12–14 but it is important to improve its biocompatibility and wettability by  coating with silica.15 These Gd-NPs are traditionally prepared by complicated two-step  chemical methods using Stober chemistry.16,17 In this paper, Gd-NPs are prepared by  a simple and facile laser ablation in liquid (LAL) approach.18,19 LAL is a unique and  efficient technique, which has been widely used to generate NPs.20–22 However, little Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Journal Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2014 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Tian et al Running head recto: Gd2O3@SiO2 nanoparticles DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S66164",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/80/2f/ijn-9-4043.PMC4149443.pdf

"In recent years, nanomedicine platforms that combine therapeutic agents, molecular  targeting, and diagnostic imaging capabilities, termed as theranostics, are emerging  as the next generation of multifunctional nanomedicine to improve the therapeutic  outcome of cancer therapy.2–4 Unlike traditional small molecular contrast agents or  drugs, theranostic nanomedicine has the potential to provide simultaneous molecular  diagnosis and therapeutic treatment in one system.5 Such integrated diagnostic and  therapeutic designs allow for the timely tailoring of nanomedicine modules to address  the challenges of tumor heterogeneity and adaptive resistance, which can ultimately  help achieve the goal of personalized therapy for cancer.6,7Journal name: International Journal of Nanomedicine Journal Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2014 Volume: 9 Running head verso: He et al Running head recto: MION for MRI and cancer therapy DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S61880",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/8b/3a/ijn-9-4055.PMC4149452.pdf
