"Keywords:  colitis, colorectal cancer, inflammation, IL-17 Introduction Interleukin-17 (IL-17 or IL-17A) is a proinflammatory cytokine.1 It binds to a  heterodimer of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) complex,  and subsequently activates nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) activator 1 (Act1) through a sim - ilar expression to fibroblast growth factor genes, IL-17 receptors, and the Toll–IL-1R  (SEFIR) domain.2–6 Act1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which activates tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) through lysine-63-linked ubiquitination.7  The polyubiquitinated TRAF6 activates transforming growth factor- β-activated kinase 1   (TAK1) and then I κB kinase (IKK) complex, which subsequently activates the  NF-κB pathway to initiate transcription of a variety of chemokines, cytokines, and  growth factor, such as C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), IL-6, and vascular endothelial  growth factor (VEGF).8–10 Some previous studies have demonstrated that IL-17 can  stabilize downstream CXCL1  messenger (m)RNA through an inducible kinase IKKi- dependent Act1–TRAF2–TRAF5 complex, which binds to splicing factor 2 (SF2)  (also named alternative splicing factor [ASF]) and prevents SF2/ASF-mediated mRNA correspondence: Xiaolan Zhang Department of gastroenterology, second  hospital of hebei Medical University, no 80 huanghe avenue, shijiazhuang,  hebei 050035, People’s republic of china Tel +86 158 0321 2979 Fax +86 311 6600 7370 email xiaolanzh@126.co m Journal name: Drug Design, Development and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2015 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Xie et al Running head recto: Colon cancer is associated with increased IL-17 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S79431",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/22/70/dddt-9-1679.PMC4370916.pdf
