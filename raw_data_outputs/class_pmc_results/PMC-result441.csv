"In addition to general age-related functional impairment, older people are at  increased risk of diseases such as dementia, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.1  In the current health care system, several health care providers, with different finan - cial systems and areas of competence, are offering acute and long-term treatment and  care.2,3 The complexity of the cooperation between different health care levels makes  the process of moving across these levels challenging.4,5 Care transition is understood  as the continuity of health care when the patient is transferred across different health  care levels.3 Older people are large consumers of health care services, which leave  them vulnerable to adverse incidents and make them a target for alterations to reduce  medical costs.6–9 To meet the needs and preferences of older patients better, research  has altered focus from a health-administrative perspective on care transition to the  patients’ experiences of the continuity of care during care transition.10,11 Theories such  as person-centered care, based on values of mutual respect, self-determination, and  understanding, have been widely acknowledged.12 A successful care transition of older  patients, across health care levels, forms the basis of well functioning and continuous  residential treatment and care.3,13correspondence: else cathrine rustad stord/haugesund University college,  Klingenbergvegen 8, n-5414 stord,  norway email else.rustad@hsh.n o Journal name: Patient Preference and Adherence Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Rustad et al Running head recto: Older patients’ experiences during care transition DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S97570",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/df/ea/ppa-10-769.PMC4869594.pdf

"Keywords:  cisplatin, F98EGFR rat glioma, molecular targets, peptides, monoclonal antibodies Introduction Malignant gliomas are fast growing, highly invasive brain tumors that usually lead  to death within 12–18 months following diagnosis.1 These tumors are resistant to  all current forms of therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.2  Although the 2-year survival has increased to almost 25%, the 5-year survival of  patients has remained very low2 despite intensive efforts to develop more effective  therapies.3 Significant advances have been made in understanding the molecular  genetic events leading to the development and progression of gliomas.4 However,  this still has not resulted in therapeutic agents that could specifically target gliomas  and alter their highly invasive pattern of growth within the brain.5,6 One significant correspondence: rolf F Barth Department of Pathology, The Ohio state  University, 4132 graves hall, 333 West  10th avenue, columbus, Oh 43210, Usa Tel +1 614 292 2177 Fax +1 614 292 5849 email rolf.barth@osumc.ed u Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2016 Volume: 9 Running head verso: Barth et al Running head recto: Cisplatin-containing EGFR targeting bioconjugates DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S99242",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/7b/be/ott-9-2769.PMC4869632.pdf
