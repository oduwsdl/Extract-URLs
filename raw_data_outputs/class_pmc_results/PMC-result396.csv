"Key Words zz vertigo, vestibulo-ocular reflex, cerebellopontine-angle tumor, head impulse test,  flocculus.Bilaterally Abnormal Head Impulse Tests Indicate   a Large Cerebellopontine Angle Tumor INTRODUCTION  Head impulse tests (HITs) can evaluate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) elicited by high- velocity and high-acceleration stimuli.1 The findings of HITs are typically abnormal during  head rotation toward the lesion side in the presence of peripheral vestibulopathy,1,2 but are  mostly normal in central vestibular disorders.3,4 However, HIT findings may be abnormal  bilaterally in unilateral lesions involving the vestibular nucleus or cerebellar flocculus.3,5  Tumors involving the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) pose a diagnostic challenge due to  their diverse manifestations.6,7 Various tests have been used to evaluate the audiovestibular  function in the presence of a CPA tumor, including vestibular schwannomas.8,9 Even  though HITs have been used to evaluate vestibular function in various peripheral and cen - tral disorders involving the vestibular system,10-12 few studies have explored the head im - pulse gain of the VOR in patients with a vestibular schwannoma.9,13,14 A previous study  found that the VOR gains decreased during ipsilesional HITs, and that there was a correla - tion between the gain and tumor size in vestibular schwannoma.9 The present study was Hyo-Jung Kima*  Seong-Ho Parkb*  Ji-Soo Kimb  Ja Won Kooc  Chae-Yong Kimd  Young-Hoon Kimd  Jung Ho Hand a Department of Biomedical Laboratory  Science, Kyungdong University,   Goseong, Korea bDepartments of Neurology,   c Otolaryngology, and dNeurosurgery,  Seoul National University   College of Medicine,   Seoul National University   Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, KoreapISSN 1738-6586 / eISSN 2005-5013   /   J Clin Neurol 2016 ;12(1):65-74   /   http://dx.doi.org/10.3988/jcn.2016.12.1.65 Received  September 6, 2015 Revised  September 11, 2015 Accepted  September 14, 2015 Correspondence Ji-Soo Kim, MD, PhD Department of Neurology,  Seoul National University  College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital,  82 Gumo-ro 173beon-gil, Bundang,   Seongnam 13620, KoreaTel    +82-31-787-7463 Fax   +82-31-719-6828 E-mail    jisookim@snu.ac.kr *These authors equally contributed to  this study.",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/2d/a3/jcn-12-65.PMC4712288.pdf
