"ALK is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is expressed in neural tissue,  the small intestine, and the testes, and plays a crucial role in the development of the  central nervous system (CNS).5 The ALK receptor is activated after ligand binding  to the extracellular receptor domain and dimerization.4 The EML4–ALK fusion gene  arises from an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2.4 Several variants of EML4– ALK have been described that encode the same cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain  of ALK with different truncations of EML4.6,7 Aberrant ALK activation leads to an  activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways, primarily the PI3K/mTOR and  RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade.8–10 The EML4–ALK rearrangement in patients with NSCLC is a relatively rare event,  and it is present in approximately 2%–8% of NSCLC patients.4,7,11 It is most commonly  seen in younger patients with adenocarcinoma histology with never- or light-smoking Correspondence: Sacha i Rothschild Department of internal Medicine, Medical  Oncology, University Hospital Basel,  Petersgraben 4, 4031 Basel, Switzerland Tel +41 61 265 5074 Fax +41 61 265 5316 email sacha.rothschild@usb.c h Journal name: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Article Designation: Review Y ear: 2016 Volume: 12 Running head verso: Rothschild Running head recto: ALK-positive NSCLC – critical appraisal of ceritinib DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S87876",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/62/4e/tcrm-12-735.PMC4863587.pdf
