"Keywords:  neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus,  surgery, prognosis Introduction Primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE) is an extremely rare disease,  representing only 0.005%–4% of esophageal cancers (ECs) and 0.004%–4.6% of  all gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms.1,2 On account of its rarity, a standard  treatment has not yet been established.2 Patients with SCCE have been treated with  surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, alone or in combination.1 However, the  outcome for SCCE remains grim due to a poor therapeutic response and a high rate  of disease recurrence.3 Recently, there is increasing evidence that systemic inflammatory response plays  an important role in postoperative survival in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.4–6  Previous studies have shown that pretreatment neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), correspondence: Jun Feng liu Department of Thoracic surgery,  The Fourth hospital of hebei  Medical University, 12, Jiankang road,  shijiazhuang, hebei Province, china Tel +86 311 8609 5353 email 20504744@qq.co m Journal name: OncoTargets and Therapy Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 10 Running head verso: Wang and Liu Running head recto: NLR in primary small cell carcinoma of esophagus DOI: http://dx.doi.org/ 10.2147/OTT.S11563 7",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/18/24/ott-10-2453.PMC5426465.pdf

"Keywords:  cystic fibrosis, adherence, telehealth Introduction Nebulized medication is an integral part of treatment for many children and young  people with cystic fibrosis (CF), but due to a high treatment burden, adherence rates to  nebulized therapy are often suboptimal.1 Patients with low adherence rates to nebulized  medication have been shown to have more pulmonary exacerbations requiring a course  of intravenous antibiotics.2 This increased morbidity has been shown to increase health  care utilization and associated cost.3 Adherence to nebulized medication is difficult to accurately measure, as subjective  measures such as asking the patient and self-filled questionnaires have been shown  to overestimate rates due to the social desirability bias.1 Prescription refill data are  more objective, but they have also been shown to overestimate rates, as there is no  guarantee that dispensed medication is actually taken.1correspondence: robert W Morton Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Sheffield Children’s  Hospital, Western Bank, Sheffield S10  2Th, UK Tel +44 79 6878 8032 email rwmorton99@gmail.co m Journal name: Patient Preference and Adherence Article Designation: Original Research Y ear: 2017 Volume: 11 Running head verso: Morton et al Running head recto: Improving adherence to medication by text message reminders DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S123723",Non-OADS,/arxiv_data1/oa_pdf/89/93/ppa-11-861.PMC5428764.pdf
