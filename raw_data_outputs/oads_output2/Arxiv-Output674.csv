于股价影响的持续性。 TH Nguyen 等利用主题模型 来预测股票价格。在文献 [6]中，他们提 出了一个融合情感 和话题的主题模型， 并将该模型运用到股票相关新闻的主题分析中。在 获 得了每个新闻的主题分布向量后 ，他们将这个主题分布向量 加入到股票预测的特征中，最终 获得了不错的 预测效果。这种主题模型特征 是一种通用的 文本特征，忽视了 金融市场新闻的 特殊性。 近几年来，深度学习 方法在自然语言处理领域 取得了许多进展，Xiao Ding 等将深 度学习方法运用到 股票预测领域。在文献 [7]中，他们提出 了一种新的事件抽取 方法，从新 闻中抽取 出结构化的事件。这些结构化的事件成为神经网络的输入 ，用于预测 股票价格。 随 后，在事件抽取工作的基础上，他们在文献 [8]中进一步学习 出结构化事件的 event  embedding1，并使用卷积 神经网络 模型去预测股票价格 。这种模型虽然 考虑了事件对于 股价 的持续影响， 但是忽略 了多个事件 对于股价的综合作用。   除了与股票相关的 新闻信息 ，大众媒体与社交媒体上的 内容也被用于股票预测。 不过这 些媒体上的内容一般不适用于单个股票的预测， 只能对股市整体 的情况（ 道琼斯工业指数、 上证指数等） 作出预测 。Johan Bollen 等在文献 [9]中运用 Twitter上的内容对股市的涨跌 作出 预测。他们 使用 OpinionFinder2等工具分析 Twitter上每天的大众情感，然后将这些情感特征 加入到预测模型中，对股市的涨跌作出预测。    本文余下 的部分组织如下：第 2部分给出 了问题描述以及本文方法 的概览；第3部分详 细介绍新闻特征 抽取和循环神经网络模型 ；第4部分描述了使用 的数据集以及模型在 数据集 上的实验效果；第 5部分总结 本文的内容。  2 问题描述和方法综述   股票价格预测 是指利用股票 价格的历史信息以及与股票相关的市场信息 ，预测股票在未 来一段时间内的涨跌情况或者价格情况。 本文的研究主要针 对在上海证券交易 所3挂牌的 A 股4股票，也即“上证A股” 。   2.1 股票预测问题   股票在一个交易日 会有一些交易特征，例如开盘价，收盘价5，最高价，交易量等 ，其 中收盘价一般被用于代表股票在这一天的价格。 于是在一段连续的时间内， 某只股票会产生 一个收盘价格的序列。我们记这段连续 的价格序列为 ：    其中 代表该股票在第t个交易日 的收盘价格。   除了基本 的价格信息， 股票在某些交易日还会 有与之相关的新闻事件6。我们记这段连 续的时间内，与该股票相关的新闻序列为：     其中 表示第t个交易日内 发生的新闻集合。新闻文本 可以看作 单词的序列，对于中文 文本而言，即新闻内容进行 分词后的序列 。新闻集合 可表示为单词序列：     表示单词 表 中的一个单词， 表示第t个交易日新闻的长度。   我们进一步 定义股票在每天的涨跌情况为：                                                            1 类似于 word2vec 中word embbed ing是对单词的表示 ，event embedding 是对结构化 事件的表示   2 OpinionFinder 网站： http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/opinionfinder/ ，一个开源情感 极性分析工具   3 上海证券交易所官网： www.sse.com.cn   4 A股：人民币普通股票 ，它是由我国境内的公司发行， 供境内机构、组织和个人 以人民币认购和交易的 普通股票。   5 指股票在交易日里最后一笔买卖的成交价格   6 与股票相关的新闻事件 ：上市公司公告 、收购、内幕 丑闻等事件,Non-OADS,1707.07585v1.pdf

4 实验  4.1 数据集描述  数据集分为股票价格和新闻语料两部分 。我们从投资之家11上抓取了上证 A股市场从 2013年1月到2015年10月的股票 价格信息 ，从搜狐证券版块12获取了这段时间内 的新闻页 面。为了将新闻与 股票对齐 ，我们保留标题 中出现股票名称 的新闻，并认为这则新闻与该只 股票相关 。 对于标题中没有出现 股票名称的新闻， 我们 将其过滤。 最后新闻集中包含了 85060 篇与上证 A股市场相关的新闻。 数据集的基本信息如表 2所示。  表 2：数据集概况   Tab 2: Overview of dataset   交易日起止时间  2013-01-01至2015-08-31  交易天数  644  股票数量 1078  相关新闻 篇数 85060    数据集包含了上证 A股市场 1000多只股票从2013年1月到2015年8月的价格信息。 每个交易日都 有开盘价、收盘价、最高价和交易量等信息。 实验中我们 按照股票 相关新闻的 数量，选取了两组股票， 分别对它们进行预测 。如表 3所示，前 5只股票是相关新闻数量较 多的股票，后 5只股票是相关新闻数量 较少的股票 。  表 3：新闻密度较高的股票   Tab 3: stocks wi th lots of related news   股票代码  股票名称  交易日数 相关新闻天数   600030  中信证券  644 304  600519  贵州茅台  644 198  601998  中信银行  644 261  601318  中国平安  643 229  601628  中国人寿  643 205  600795  国电电力  623 109  601186  中国铁建  613 94  600277  亿利能源  556 73  600887  伊利股份  619 156  600703  三安光电  584 112    表3中前5只股票在搜狐证券中 有较多的相关新闻 ，比如“中信证券”， 644个交易日 中有304天出现了与之相关的 新闻，平均每两个交易日有一则相关新闻 。而后5只股票相关 新闻数量较少， 比如“中国铁建 ”，613个交易日中 只有94天出现相关新闻 。    表4：利好种子集 与利空种子集  Tab 4:  Good and bad set of seed words   种子集 内容   利好种子集  {受益、提升、改善、稳健、看好、有望、增、收 购、利好、优势 }  利空种子 集 {下滑、低于、下降、拖 累、跌、降、亏损、违规、 处罚、利空 }                                                           11 http://www.inv.org.cn/   12 http://stock.sohu.com/,Non-OADS,1707.07585v1.pdf
