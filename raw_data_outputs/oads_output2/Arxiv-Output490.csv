"Gold standard labelling  The gold standard labelling on SEM samples was created as follows: (i) Myelin sheaths were manually segmented (inner and  outer contours) with GIMP ( https://www.gimp.org/ ); (ii) Axon labels were obtained by filling the region enclosed by the  inner border of the myelin sheaths; (iii) Small manual corrections were done on the axon and myelin masks (contour  refinement, elimination of false positives) when necessary.",Non-OADS,1711.01004v2.pdf
