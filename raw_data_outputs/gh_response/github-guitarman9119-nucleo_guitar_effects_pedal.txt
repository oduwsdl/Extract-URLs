Certain styles of playing requires specific effects. To achieve this guitarists use effect units which are commonly known as effects pedals. An effects pedal is an electronic device that uses the output signal from the guitar pick-up as input and changes the signal by applying signal processing techniques to create an altered output signal. These pedals come in various price ranges, but it does not offer the guitarist the possibility to create his own effects by reprogramming the effects pedal or using a custom effect. With the advancement in digital signal processors and the improvement in the field of music and electronics, it has become possible to create a multi-effects pedal capable of processing audio in real time. The primary aim of this project is to design and construct a multi-effects pedal that can be reprogrammed for the electric guitar. The multi-effects pedal and guitar should be able to be reprogrammed using a computer or function without any other external accessories when just practising. This functionality is important for the guitarist. The main objective was achieved by designing and constructing an multi-effects pedal that allows the user to reprogram the effects pedal. Evaluation and testing were done to ensure that the simulated effects in Simulink were correctly implemented on the digital signal processor. Various tests were done to ensure that the effects pedal was functioning as expected and that the pedal is easy to use.", "fork": false, "url":
