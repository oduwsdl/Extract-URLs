Its motivation is the current lack of mid-level abstraction tools for scenes with primitives involving intersection shaders. Those scenes impose strict engine design choices, since they need flexibility in the shader table setup. Proceduray aims to provide a fair tradeoff between that flexibility and productivity. It also aims to be didactic. Shader table behaviour can be very confusing because parameters for indexing it come from different parts of a system, involving both host and device code. This is different in essence than ray tracing triangle meshes (which uses a builtin intersection shader for all objects) or rendering with the traditional graphics or compute pipelines.", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray", "forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/forks", "keys_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/keys{/key_id}", "collaborators_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/collaborators{/collaborator}", "teams_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/teams", "hooks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/hooks", "issue_events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/issues/events{/number}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/events", "assignees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/assignees{/user}", "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/branches{/branch}", "tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/tags", "blobs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/git/blobs{/sha}", "git_tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/git/tags{/sha}", "git_refs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/git/refs{/sha}", "trees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/git/trees{/sha}", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/statuses/{sha}", "languages_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/languages", "stargazers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/stargazers", "contributors_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/contributors", "subscribers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/subscribers", "subscription_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/subscription", "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/commits{/sha}", "git_commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/git/commits{/sha}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/comments{/number}", "issue_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/issues/comments{/number}", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/contents/{+path}", "compare_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/compare/{base}...{head}", "merges_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/merges", "archive_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/{archive_format}{/ref}", "downloads_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/downloads", "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/issues{/number}", "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/pulls{/number}", "milestones_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/milestones{/number}", "notifications_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/notifications{?since,all,participating}", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/labels{/name}", "releases_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/releases{/id}", "deployments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray/deployments", "created_at": "2021-05-13T20:57:10Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-09T05:14:27Z", "pushed_at": "2021-08-06T20:20:01Z", "git_url": "git://github.com/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray.git", "ssh_url": "git@github.com:dsilvavinicius/Proceduray.git", "clone_url": "https://github.com/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray.git", "svn_url": "https://github.com/dsilvavinicius/Proceduray", "homepage": null, "size": 154961, "stargazers_count": 5, "watchers_count": 5, "language": "C++", "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_downloads": true, "has_wiki": true, "has_pages": false, "has_discussions": false, "forks_count": 0, "mirror_url": null, "archived": false, "disabled": false, "open_issues_count": 0, "license": { "key": "mit", "name": "MIT License", "spdx_id": "MIT", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/mit", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz" }, "allow_forking": true, "is_template": false, "web_commit_signoff_required": false, "topics": [ ], "visibility": "public", "forks": 0, "open_issues": 0, "watchers": 5, "default_branch": "master", "permissions": { "admin": false, "maintain": false, "push": false, "triage": false, "pull": true }, "temp_clone_token": "", "network_count": 0, "subscribers_count": 1 }
