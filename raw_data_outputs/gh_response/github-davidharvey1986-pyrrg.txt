Measuring the 2nd and 4th order moments it uses a TinyTim model to correct for PSF distortions. It is invariant to number exposures, ortientation of the drizzle images. Using a machine learning algorithm it automatically star and galaxy classifies, howeve the user is able to do this manually if not accurate enough.
