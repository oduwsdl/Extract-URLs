The release consists of a Python module. Most of the code is to be run within the CASA shell, except for a one dimensional version of the algorithm, supporting native Python2.7. Line-Stacker currently only supports Image stacking. Some additional tools, allowing further analysis of the stack product are also included in the module. Further details on the performances and capabilities of Line-Stacker will be found in Jolly et al. 2020 (submitted).", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker", "forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/forks", "keys_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/keys{/key_id}", "collaborators_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/collaborators{/collaborator}", "teams_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/teams", "hooks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/hooks", "issue_events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/issues/events{/number}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/events", "assignees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/assignees{/user}", "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/branches{/branch}", "tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/tags", "blobs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/git/blobs{/sha}", "git_tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/git/tags{/sha}", "git_refs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/git/refs{/sha}", "trees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/git/trees{/sha}", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/statuses/{sha}", "languages_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/languages", "stargazers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/stargazers", "contributors_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/contributors", "subscribers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/subscribers", "subscription_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/subscription", "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/commits{/sha}", "git_commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/git/commits{/sha}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/comments{/number}", "issue_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/issues/comments{/number}", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/contents/{+path}", "compare_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/compare/{base}...{head}", "merges_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/merges", "archive_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/{archive_format}{/ref}", "downloads_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/downloads", "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/issues{/number}", "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/pulls{/number}", "milestones_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/milestones{/number}", "notifications_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/notifications{?since,all,participating}", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/labels{/name}", "releases_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/releases{/id}", "deployments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jbjolly/LineStacker/deployments", "created_at": "2019-06-06T13:48:39Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-18T09:22:13Z", "pushed_at": "2022-10-18T09:21:22Z", "git_url": "git://github.com/jbjolly/LineStacker.git", "ssh_url": "git@github.com:jbjolly/LineStacker.git", "clone_url": "https://github.com/jbjolly/LineStacker.git", "svn_url": "https://github.com/jbjolly/LineStacker", "homepage": "", "size": 37191, "stargazers_count": 4, "watchers_count": 4, "language": "Python", "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_downloads": true, "has_wiki": true, "has_pages": true, "has_discussions": false, "forks_count": 1, "mirror_url": null, "archived": false, "disabled": false, "open_issues_count": 0, "license": { "key": "other", "name": "Other", "spdx_id": "NOASSERTION", "url": null, "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTA=" }, "allow_forking": true, "is_template": false, "web_commit_signoff_required": false, "topics": [ ], "visibility": "public", "forks": 1, "open_issues": 0, "watchers": 4, "default_branch": "master", "permissions": { "admin": false, "maintain": false, "push": false, "triage": false, "pull": true }, "temp_clone_token": "", "network_count": 1, "subscribers_count": 2 }
