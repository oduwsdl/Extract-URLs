The notebooks moreover contain descriptive and visual analyses of the used datasets, as well as the implementation of a range of prediction models including XGB and LSTM, and the application of the two explanation methods LIME and SHAP.", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/MHonegger/explanation_consistency", "forks_url":
