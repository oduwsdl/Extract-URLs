Although powerful, such systems re- quire manual configuration and tuning. To this end, we view DNNs as configurable systems and propose an end-to-end framework that allows the configuration, evaluation and automated search for DNN architectures. Our FM and framework have been released in this repository to support replication and future research.", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet", "forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/forks", "keys_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/keys{/key_id}", "collaborators_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/collaborators{/collaborator}", "teams_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/teams", "hooks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/hooks", "issue_events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/issues/events{/number}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/events", "assignees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/assignees{/user}", "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/branches{/branch}", "tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/tags", "blobs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/git/blobs{/sha}", "git_tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/git/tags{/sha}", "git_refs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/git/refs{/sha}", "trees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/git/trees{/sha}", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/statuses/{sha}", "languages_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/languages", "stargazers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/stargazers", "contributors_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/contributors", "subscribers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/subscribers", "subscription_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/subscription", "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/commits{/sha}", "git_commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/git/commits{/sha}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/comments{/number}", "issue_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/issues/comments{/number}", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/contents/{+path}", "compare_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/compare/{base}...{head}", "merges_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/merges", "archive_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/{archive_format}{/ref}", "downloads_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/downloads", "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/issues{/number}", "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/pulls{/number}", "milestones_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/milestones{/number}", "notifications_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/notifications{?since,all,participating}", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/labels{/name}", "releases_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/releases{/id}", "deployments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/yamizi/FeatureNet/deployments", "created_at": "2019-04-01T16:18:11Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-25T16:48:54Z", "pushed_at": "2022-11-21T21:07:11Z", "git_url": "git://github.com/yamizi/FeatureNet.git", "ssh_url": "git@github.com:yamizi/FeatureNet.git", "clone_url": "https://github.com/yamizi/FeatureNet.git", "svn_url": "https://github.com/yamizi/FeatureNet", "homepage": "", "size": 20157, "stargazers_count": 3, "watchers_count": 3, "language": "Python", "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_downloads": true, "has_wiki": true, "has_pages": false, "has_discussions": false, "forks_count": 4, "mirror_url": null, "archived": false, "disabled": false, "open_issues_count": 5, "license": null, "allow_forking": true, "is_template": false, "web_commit_signoff_required": false, "topics": [ "architecture", "configurable-software", "deep-learning", "machine-learning" ], "visibility": "public", "forks": 4, "open_issues": 5, "watchers": 3, "default_branch": "master", "permissions": { "admin": false, "maintain": false, "push": false, "triage": false, "pull": true }, "temp_clone_token": "", "network_count": 4, "subscribers_count": 4 }
