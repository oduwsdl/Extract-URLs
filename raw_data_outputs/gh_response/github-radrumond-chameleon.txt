In most current practices, this is accomplished by using some form of random initialization. Instead, recent work shows that a specific initial parameter set can be learned from a population of tasks, i.e., dataset and target variable for supervised learning tasks. Using this initial parameter set leads to faster convergence for new tasks (model-agnostic meta-learning). Currently, methods for learning model initializations are limited to a population of tasks sharing the same schema, i.e., the same number, order, type and semantics of predictor and target variables. In this paper, we address the problem of meta-learning parameter initialization across tasks with different schemas, i.e., if the number of predictors varies across tasks, while they still share some variables. We propose Chameleon, a model that learns to align different predictor schemas to a common representation. We use permutations and masks of the predictors of the training tasks at hand. In experiments on real-life data sets, we show that Chameleon successfully can learn parameter initializations across tasks with different schemas providing a 26\\% lift on accuracy on average over random initialization and of 5\\% over a state-of-the-art method for fixed-schema learning model initializations. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work on the problem of learning model initialization across tasks with different schemas.", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon", "forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/forks", "keys_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/keys{/key_id}", "collaborators_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/collaborators{/collaborator}", "teams_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/teams", "hooks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/hooks", "issue_events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/issues/events{/number}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/events", "assignees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/assignees{/user}", "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/branches{/branch}", "tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/tags", "blobs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/git/blobs{/sha}", "git_tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/git/tags{/sha}", "git_refs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/git/refs{/sha}", "trees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/git/trees{/sha}", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/statuses/{sha}", "languages_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/languages", "stargazers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/stargazers", "contributors_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/contributors", "subscribers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/subscribers", "subscription_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/subscription", "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/commits{/sha}", "git_commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/git/commits{/sha}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/comments{/number}", "issue_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/issues/comments{/number}", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/contents/{+path}", "compare_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/compare/{base}...{head}", "merges_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/merges", "archive_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/{archive_format}{/ref}", "downloads_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/downloads", "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/issues{/number}", "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/pulls{/number}", "milestones_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/milestones{/number}", "notifications_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/notifications{?since,all,participating}", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/labels{/name}", "releases_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/releases{/id}", "deployments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/radrumond/Chameleon/deployments", "created_at": "2019-09-25T13:23:59Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-02T18:27:39Z", "pushed_at": "2020-03-20T15:48:06Z", "git_url": "git://github.com/radrumond/Chameleon.git", "ssh_url": "git@github.com:radrumond/Chameleon.git", "clone_url": "https://github.com/radrumond/Chameleon.git", "svn_url": "https://github.com/radrumond/Chameleon", "homepage": "", "size": 61, "stargazers_count": 5, "watchers_count": 5, "language": "Python", "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_downloads": true, "has_wiki": true, "has_pages": true, "has_discussions": false, "forks_count": 5, "mirror_url": null, "archived": false, "disabled": false, "open_issues_count": 2, "license": null, "allow_forking": true, "is_template": false, "web_commit_signoff_required": false, "topics": [ ], "visibility": "public", "forks": 5, "open_issues": 2, "watchers": 5, "default_branch": "master", "permissions": { "admin": false, "maintain": false, "push": false, "triage": false, "pull": true }, "temp_clone_token": "", "network_count": 5, "subscribers_count": 2 }
