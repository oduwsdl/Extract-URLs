We explore an error back-propagation method of SNN based on gradient descent. The chain rule proved mathematically that it is sufficient to update the SNNâ€™s synaptic weights by directly using an optimizer. Utilizing the TensorFlow framework, a bilayer supervised learning SNN is constructed from scratch. We take the lead in the application of SAR image classification and conduct experiments on the MSTAR dataset.", "fork": false, "url":
