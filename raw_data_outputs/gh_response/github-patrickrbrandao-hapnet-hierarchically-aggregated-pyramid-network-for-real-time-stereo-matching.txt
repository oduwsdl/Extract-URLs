This makes training our network significantly more efficient and avoids the needs for large memory allocation. Our method performs well, especially around regions compromising multiple discontinuities around surgical instrumentation or around complex small structures and instruments. The method compares well to the state-of-the-art techniques while taking a different methodological angle to computational stereo problem in surgical video.", "fork": false, "url":
