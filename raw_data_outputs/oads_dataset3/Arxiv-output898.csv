第1章 引言第1章 引言随着智能互联网时代的到来和发展，个性化推荐作为理解用户的核心技术之一成为智能网络的重要组成部分，并在各种实际系统中得到广泛应用。长期以来，个性化推荐技术的研究集中于如何为用户提供更为准确的被推荐物品，而在很大程度上忽视了推荐系统的可解释性， 不利于推荐系统对用户的透明度和可信度。 在本研究中，我们从数据、模型和结果三个方面对推荐系统的可解释性进行研究，力图做到不仅知其然更知其所以然，并在互联网真实用户场景下对理论模型进行实验验证。本章旨在阐述研究背景，简要回顾个性化推荐系统的主要技术与历史现状，给出本文的研究问题、面临的主要挑战及其实际意义和科学价值，并描述本工作的主要贡献和章节安排。1.1研究背景互联网的快速发展开启了人类活动线上化的进程，越来越多传统上只能在线下完成的任务变得可以方便快捷地在互联网上完成。已经深入人们日常生活中的电子商务就是这一进程的典型代表，例如阿里巴巴1/bigcircle、京东商城2/bigcircle、亚马逊网络商城3/bigcircle等电子商务网站的普及，使得人们不必走出家门即可购买自己所需要的商品，并且可以在更多的备选商品中进行挑选。不仅限于电子商务应用，社交网络平台如新浪微博4/bigcircle和Facebook5/bigcircle的兴起使得人们可以在互联网上交友、沟通、获取实时资讯；在线叫车服务如滴滴6/bigcircle和Uber7/bigcircle的发展使得用户不再需要线下街头打车；在线P2P借贷服务如宜信8/bigcircle和Prosper9/bigcircle使得用户线上借贷和理财成为可能；在线房地产业务如Zillow10/bigcircle和Airbnb11/bigcircle的发展则使传统的房地产业务逐步线上化；在线自由职业平台如猪八戒网12/bigcircle和亚马逊MTurk13/bigcircle的迅速发展甚至使得自由职业1/bigcircle阿里巴巴，中国最大的电子商务企业平台：http://www.alibaba.com，http://www.taobao.com2/bigcircle京东，中国最大的自主经营式电子商务平台：http://www.jd.com3/bigcircle亚马逊，美国著名电子商务网站，在世界主要国家提供服务：http://www.amazon.com4/bigcircle新浪微博，中国主要的微博客社交网络平台，http://www.weibo.com5/bigcircleFacebook（脸谱） ，全球最大的社交网络平台，http://www.facebook.com6/bigcircle滴滴，中国最大的互联网在线打车服务：http://www.xiaojukeji.com7/bigcircle优步，美国在线打车服务公司，在世界许多国家提供服务：http://www.uber.com8/bigcircle宜信宜人贷，中国最早开始网络贷款服务的公司：http://www.creditease.cn9/bigcircleProsper，美国在线P2P借贷服务平台：http://www.prosper.com10/bigcircleZillow，美国主要的在线房地产买卖业务平台：http://www.zillow.com11/bigcircleAirbnb，全球主要的P2P租房服务平台：http://www.airbnb.com12/bigcircle猪八戒，中国最大的在线自由职业平台：http://www.zbj.com13/bigcircleMTurk，亚马逊旗下自由职业平台：http://www.mturk.com1,Non-OADS,1708.06013v2.pdf
第1章 引言最为广泛的推荐模型之一，然而隐变量模型将数据投影到一组未知的空间变量上，因此难以解释原有数据中用户的具体偏好，也难以据此为推荐结果给出直观的推荐理由，例如大多数电子商务推荐系统只是简单地给出“其他用户也购买了”等与真正模型无关的推荐理由，等等。在本工作中，我们提出与传统“隐变量分解模型”相对应的“显式变量分解模型”来解决模型的可解释性问题，通过引入属性词显式变量构建用户在属性词上的偏好矩阵，从而使得协同过滤算法具有明确的内在意义，并且可以为最终的推荐结果给出模型内生的推荐理由。在数据和模型的基础上，个性化推荐算法通过用户在推荐列表上的点击、购买等行为为系统创造经济效益，因此个性化推荐实际上以推荐列表的方式隐形地控制着系统中物品与用户之间的匹配，从而影响推荐算法所在经济系统（如电子商务网站）中的资源分配。虽然电子商务、在线金融等网络应用已经是一个完整的线上经济系统，然而传统的个性化推荐研究主要从计算机科学家的视角出发关心点击率、购买率等性能指标，而对个性化推荐在整个系统中的经济学意义较少研究。在本工作中，我们将个性化推荐作为经济系统中资源分配的手段，提出了网络经济系统的生产者-消费者建模框架，并给出了系统最终所实现社会效益（系统总福利）的计算方法，从而对个性化推荐的经济学意义进行解释。在此基础上，我们进一步提出基于总福利最大化的推荐算法，从而在提高推荐系统用户体验的同时，也提高整个经济系统的社会效益。1.3本研究工作面临的主要挑战个性化推荐技术的主要研究对象丰富多变，概括而言包括两大部分：其一是广泛存在于各种互联网应用中的被推荐物品，包括商品、视频、音乐、电影、新闻、金融产品、工作任务等方方面面；其二便是购买、消费和操作这些物品的网络用户。用户与物品之间交互方式的多样性、行为记录的丰富性、兴趣偏好的动态性，为个性化推荐技术的研究及其解释带来了诸多挑战，如图1.4所示，这主要包括如下几个方面：庞大的数据规模：在典型的互联网应用中往往存在者数量极为庞大的用户和物品，例如据全球最大的用户评论网站Yelp1/bigcircle统计报告指出，截至2016年初其日活跃用户达1.35亿，并且拥有9500万用户评论历史记录；中国主要的电子商务网站淘宝网和京东商城的活跃用户同样数以亿计；而百度、谷歌、Facebook等搜索和社交网站的活跃用户更是达到数以十亿计。庞大的数据规模对用户偏好建模和个性化推荐算法的可行性和实时性提出了较高的要求。在本工作中，我们提出了矩1/bigcircleYelp，全球最大的用户评论网站，http://www.yelp.com6,None,None

"第4章 模型的可解释性制没有直接关系，例如在购物网站中常见的“80%的用户也查看了” ，以及在社交网站中“您的好友也查看了”等推荐理由[189,190]，然而类似的推荐理由往往过于简化了物品得到推荐的真正原因。与此不同的是，在本工作中我们提出由模型直接生成的短语级个性化推荐理由，在此基础上我们不但可以给出个性化推荐，还可以给出个性化“不”推荐，即告诉用户当前查看的物品可能并不适合购买，从而提高系统的可用性和可信度。4.1.3基于用户评论的情感词典构建我们首先利用大规模评论语料构建情感词典L， 为此我们设计和开发了短语级情感分析工具包，其中包括基于统计自然语言处理的属性观点词对挖掘系统[208]，以及基于迭代优化的情感极性自动标注算法[207,209]，同时该工具包支持共享和下载1/bigcircle。短语级情感词典的构建主要包括如下三个步骤：首先，我们基于语法和词法分析从大规模评论语料中抽取属性词集合F；其次，我们抽取观点词集合O，并基于语法规则对评论中的每一个属性词匹配相对应的情感词，从而构建属性情感词对；最后，我们基于标签扩散的方法对属性观点词对进行极性标注，得到每一个词对的情感得分S，并最终得到情感词典L中的各个情感词条(F,O,S)。在性能评测部分，我们将对本节所构建的情感词典的统计属性和和主要技术指标进行评测和报告。给定情感词典L和一条文本评论，我们将该评论结构化为一个属性情感对(F,S′)的集合，其中S′是在这条评论中用户在属性词F上所表达的情感极性。为了更直观地描述该过程，我们给出图4.3所示的例子。在图中所示的用户物品行为矩阵中，阴影部分表示相应用户对相应物品的评论，包括一个数值化的打分和一条文本。自此基础上，我们首先判断该文本所命中的情感词条，在本例中，表4.1本节符号表L上下文相关的情感词典(F,O,S)L中的一个词条，其中S∈[−1,1]FL的属性词集合，其中|F |=pOL的情感词集合，其中|O|=qA∈Rm×n+用户物品数值评分矩阵m,n用户数和物品数X∈Rm×p+用户属性关注度矩阵Y∈Rn×p+物品属性好评度矩阵N矩阵A,X,Y中的最高打分范围，常见系统中为5星（N=5）1/bigcirclehttp://yongfeng.me/software63",None,None

第5章 推荐的经济学解释出了在N的不同取值下更完整的实验结果。 0204060801000200040006000800010000 NSocial surplus per user ($)CFTSM0.1TSM1TSM2TSM5TSM10 图5.5在总福利（TS）指标上我们的总福利最大化框架（TSMη）与协同过滤算法（CF）的对比，需要注意的是TS@N表示top-N推荐列表被用户完全接受时所产生的总福利由结果可见我们的总福利最大化模型TSM要一致地好于协同过滤基线算法CF。这实际上是在意料之中的结果，因为我们的框架本身就设计为对总福利进行最大化（如公式5-17） 。另外，我们发现η越小，我们的总福利最大化模型越能得到更高的总福利值。参数η的这一性质进一步验证了公式5-17中总福利项和数量约束项各自的作用。综合本小节对总福利的观测结果和上一小节对推荐效果的评测结果，可见当模型η取得合适值时，算法可以同时在推荐效果和总福利指标上取得更好的结果。这表明我们基于总福利最大化的个性化推荐模型可以在提高推荐系统对用户的使用体验的同时，增加整个系统的社会福利，从而提高系统的经济效率。5.3.2 P2P网络贷款为了对P2P在线网络贷款场景下的模型效果进行评测，我们采用著名的P2P借贷网站Prosper1/bigcircle公开的数据集[319]。从2009年第三季度起，Prosper推出了自动竞拍系统，即贷方可以设定一定的条件，当新的贷款请求发出时系统会代替贷方自动对贷款请求进行竞拍。然而，我们希望在网络经济系统中研究生产者和消费者自身的直接行为，而不是智能算法代替他们所作出的决定，因此我们选用在这1/bigcirclehttp://www.prosper.com128,Non-OADS,1708.06018v4.pdf
"第5章 推荐的经济学解释提高到每单位资本$0.21。这对于在线经济系统的资本效率和社会福利而言是重要的提升。基于双边t测验的显著性检验结果显示效果提升在p=0.01水平上显著。实际上，模型在总福利上的效果提升是在预期之内的，因为与上一小节的结果一样，我们的模型本身就试图对总福利进行最大化。然而虽然算法给出的分配方案可以获得较高的总福利，我们需要进一步验证算法所给出的分配方案对于实际的贷方而言是可以接受的。因此，我们进一步计算在我们的分配方法下那些得到满足的贷款请求最终的偿还率是多少（Percentage of Paid，PoP） ，偿还率表示了某种分配方案对投资者的安全性。结果显示，在真实分配方案中得到满足的贷款请求的最终偿还率为69.37%，而在我们的总福利最大化框架所给出的分配方案中，得到满足的贷款请求最终偿还率为73.32%，并不比真实分配方案的偿还率低。这意味着我们的总福利最大化框架可以在保证投资者的资金安全性体验的前提下提高整个经济系统的总福利。5.3.3在线自由职业与众包平台我们采用在线众包平台猪八戒网1/bigcircle（ZBJ）的数据进行实验验证，每条工作记录包括雇佣方ID、工作方ID、任务ID、工资，以及雇佣方和工作方分别对该任务在0∼5打分区间上的评分。表5.7给出了数据集的基本统计信息。表5.7猪八戒数据集的基本统计信息雇佣方人数 工作者人数任务数平均工资40,22846,856296,453￥21.68/小时雇佣方打分数 工作方打分数 雇佣方平均打分 工作方平均打分276,103241,6382.3362.405与电子商务网站的实验相同，我们利用算法最终给出的分配矩阵对工作者进行任务推荐，并在推荐性能和总福利指标上进行评测。本实验同样采用协同过滤（CF）作为基线算法——我们利用所有的工作者对任务的打分构建工作者-任务打分矩阵，并在该矩阵上进行基于协同过滤的打分预测（公式(5-6)和(5-7)）， 并 最终将工作gj分配给预测打分ˆrij最高的用户ui；而在我们的总福利最大化（TSM）框架下，一项工作被分配给Qij=1的工作者，如公式(5-30)所示。对于每一个方法，我们采用五折交叉验证的方法对训练集和测试集进行分割并进行实验，同样采用转换率（Conversion Rate，CR）进行性能评价，即在所有的任务分配中正确的任务分配（与测试集中的实际任务分配一致）所占的百分比。1/bigcirclehttp://www.zbj.com130",None,None
