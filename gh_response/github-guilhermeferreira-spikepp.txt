It provides an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C++ programming language. The tool defines a number of primitives that it makes available to C coders, which allows it to construct fuzzed messages called “SPIKES” that can be sent to a network service to hopefully induce errors. SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it’s an excellent choice for our purposes. SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.", "fork": false, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp", "forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/forks", "keys_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/keys{/key_id}", "collaborators_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/collaborators{/collaborator}", "teams_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/teams", "hooks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/hooks", "issue_events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/issues/events{/number}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/events", "assignees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/assignees{/user}", "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/branches{/branch}", "tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/tags", "blobs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/git/blobs{/sha}", "git_tags_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/git/tags{/sha}", "git_refs_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/git/refs{/sha}", "trees_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/git/trees{/sha}", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/statuses/{sha}", "languages_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/languages", "stargazers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/stargazers", "contributors_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/contributors", "subscribers_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/subscribers", "subscription_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/subscription", "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/commits{/sha}", "git_commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/git/commits{/sha}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/comments{/number}", "issue_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/issues/comments{/number}", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/contents/{+path}", "compare_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/compare/{base}...{head}", "merges_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/merges", "archive_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/{archive_format}{/ref}", "downloads_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/downloads", "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/issues{/number}", "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/pulls{/number}", "milestones_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/milestones{/number}", "notifications_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/notifications{?since,all,participating}", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/labels{/name}", "releases_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/releases{/id}", "deployments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/deployments", "created_at": "2017-03-07T18:01:00Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-09T10:57:40Z", "pushed_at": "2017-03-10T23:33:05Z", "git_url": "git://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp.git", "ssh_url": "git@github.com:guilhermeferreira/spikepp.git", "clone_url": "https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp.git", "svn_url": "https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp", "homepage": "", "size": 1873, "stargazers_count": 70, "watchers_count": 70, "language": "C", "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_downloads": true, "has_wiki": true, "has_pages": false, "has_discussions": false, "forks_count": 23, "mirror_url": null, "archived": false, "disabled": false, "open_issues_count": 3, "license": null, "allow_forking": true, "is_template": false, "web_commit_signoff_required": false, "topics": [ ], "visibility": "public", "forks": 23, "open_issues": 3, "watchers": 70, "default_branch": "master", "permissions": { "admin": false, "maintain": false, "push": false, "triage": false, "pull": true }, "temp_clone_token": "", "network_count": 23, "subscribers_count": 4 }
